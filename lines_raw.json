    "Is the banner even? Are the flowers in place? By which I mean \"completely out of view\". I'm pretty sure dragons don't like flowers. And what about the Ceremonial Dragon Fire Flame of Friendship? Is it still flaming?[flame bursts]",
    "I have ''lots'' of reasons. In fact, I wrote them down.",
    "Reason number one \u2013 I invited Dragon Lord Ember to Ponyville today. Reason two \u2013 the Dragon Lord is a dragon. Reason three \u2013 she's coming here to learn more about friendship.",
    "Which brings me to to reason number four. The Dragon Lord wants ''my'' advice, and as the new official Equestrian friendship ambassador to the dragons, I can't let her down.",
    "I... I just want things to be perfect.[tap, tap]",
    "[gasps] Thorax! You're in Ponyville!",
    "Apparently.",
    "I have no idea. [whimpers]{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}",
    "I completely forgot! Thorax wrote and said he needed to talk, and I told him to come over. I didn't realize it was the same day I invited Ember! What am I gonna do?! [teeth chattering]",
    "Probably not. Ember is tough and self-assured and intimidating. And Thorax is...",
    "Or worse \u2013 they'll ''hate'' each other! And if the leader of the changelings and the Dragon Lord get into a fight... [gulps] I could be responsible for starting a war that could ruin Equestria as we know it! [gasps][battle music][explosion]",
    "[hyperventilates]",
    "So, heh, Thorax, heh, everything good with you?",
    "No!",
    "Sounds like you really need to unwind. Uh, how about a, uh... a trip to the castle? Heh. You can't miss that view.",
    "Yeah, I'm just gonna... grab some ice cream for us and catch up. Heh-heh.[whip][whoosh][boom][fanfare plays]",
    "Dragon Lord Ember, as the official Equestrian friendship ambassador for the Dragon Lands ''and'' for Ponyville, I, Spike of Ponyville, welcome you to... uh, Ponyville. [quietly, to himself] I gotta work on my official speech.",

    "She's in her castle. D'oh!",
    "Uh, well, yeah, but... [nervous stammering]",
    "Dah. I think I feel one coming on.",
    "Or we could stay here.",
    "Ohhh.[door opens]",
    "Good. They're not here.",
    "Uh, I... I said, \"It's all clean in here!\" Uh, you must be hungry from your travels. Please, I'd love to present you with an official friendship welcome banquet.",
    "[aside] Dragons love gems!",
    "Just keep her here. [to Ember] Okay, yeah! [laughs] Enjoy all the, uh... crystal... things!",
    "Just gotta use the little dragons' room!",
    "What? Oh, right! Uh, they ran out. Heh. Hey, I'm really sorry, but I gotta borrow Twilight quickly.",
    "Be right back!",
    "Ember's here!",
    "I don't know! Ember was asking for you, Thorax wants to talk with me. We need to switch places! They might be getting suspicious.",
    "Dah! What's happening?! [whimpers]",
    "The map is calling ''me''?!",
    "I know!",
    "Okay, okay. To pull this off, I'm gonna need both of you to help. You two need to keep Ember and Thorax separate while I get ice cream.",
    "Yeeeees! Go easy on me. I'm under a lot of pressure.",
    "Friendship problem? Anypony gotta friendship problem here? Any problems to solve? Friendship problems? Friendship problems! Anypony got a friendship problem here? No? Okay.",
    "Yes! Fighting! Uh, I mean, what seems to be the problem?",
    "...and that's why you should never let cupcake flavors get in the way of your friendship.",
    "Oh, come on! Glow!",
    "Yep. [laughs] I am done with whatever Starlight says I was doing.",
    "Uh, sssssure.",
    "Well, I definitely want to help you out as quickly as possible.",
    "Thorax, uh, excuse me for a second.",
    "Ponies, please! If I may, I think I can help solve this friendship problem. You two should sit together. You both like the same place, you both ordered muffins, you're both ponies. I think if you made a little effort, you'd find\u2014 Whoa! Okay, that had to have done it. Come on, spikes. Glow! [strains, sighs]",
    "[gasps] Uh, actually, I, uh... need a minute... alone... to, uh, ''really'' come up with great advice! [pants] I'll be right back.",
    "Uh... Well, y'know, one thing friends do is let something go when it's upsetting somepony else.",
    "Uh, well, ''I've'' seen ''you''.",
    "[chatters]",
    "[screams] My worst fears are happening!",
    "''Noooo!''",
    "[panicked] Equestria as we know it is over! The war that pits changeling against dragon is about to begin! And it's all my fault! My title of Equestria's friendship ambassador is a lie\u2014! Oh. Hey. You guys aren't fighting?",
    "Because I accidentally invited you both over to Ponyville on the same day?",
    "So I... was trying to keep you apart because I didn't think you'd get along.",
    "No, no, of course not! But\u2014 Wait. Isn't that why you're here?",
    "Wait, please! [sighs] [to Thorax] I'm sorry.",
    "No, that's not it! Thorax, wait! Oh, no... What have I done?[splash][kick][splash]",
    "I think they're gone. They probably never want to see me again.[thuds]",
    "[gulps]",
    "I know. I'm so sorry.",
    "You have every right to be.",
    "Whoa.",
    "You guys ''should'' be mad at me. I was so worried about how it could go wrong, I didn't even think about how it could go right. [sighs] Can you forgive me?",
    "[laughing][spikes shimmering]",
    "No way! It's finally happening! I solved the friendship problem!",
    "Yeah, but then I solved it by learning my lesson. I should have told my two friends about each other immediately instead of assuming they wouldn't get along.",
    "[giggling]",
    "Yup.[ponies chattering]",
    "[through loudspeaker] So, as a show of unity, I present the Dragon Fire Flame of Friendship to both Dragon Lord Ember and Thorax, leader of the changeling pack! May the flame of friendship burn for eternity.[ponies cheering]",

    "Oh... okay.",
    "Great!",

    "That sounds like the ''worst'' night ever!",
    "You mean doing exactly what ''I'' wanted to do the whole time?",
    "Uh... intermission?",
    "It tells you how fast you're flying and how strong your wings are.",

    "Ow!",
    "What did he say?",
    "What's ''that''?[montage music resumes][anemometer squeaking]",
    "Actually, it was only 2.3, and\u2013 ow![zipping noise]",

    "Oh, wait! Uh, I was probably supposed to give you this one first.",
    "So you all get to help with the big fancy wedding, but ''I'm'' the one who gets to host the bachelor party! I have just one question. What's a bachelor party?",
    "[deep voice] I do. Do you? [high voice] I do! [kissing noises] [laughs nervously]",
    "[high voice] Who, me?",

    "[kissing noises and laughing]",

    "Uh, right. Uh, so... what are you wearin'?",
    "No! I-I mean, you could. It's like Rarity always says... [imitating Rarity] \"There's no such thing as overdressed, darling. You're just the best-looking pony in the room.\" [chuckles]",
    "No, don't look![teleportation zap]",
    "'Cause there was a spider there, but it's, uh, gone now, so, uh... thanks, Starlight! Byeeee![zip]",
    "Ha-ha! She had no idea. We're a good team, Sparkle!",
    "Oh. I thought you were getting her a mirror like yours.",
    "Uh, maybe you should get her a card 'cause I don't think the mirror will say all that. But I think she'll like it.",
    "Yeah, about that. Don't you need to get the castle ready for the celebration?",
    "Twilight, are you reading during a party... again?[papers rustling]",
    "Wild guess \u2013 something's wrong.",
    "Whoa!",
    "[chuckles]",
    "Huh?",
    "Where're you gonna send her? Uh, too soon?",
    "Cool spell.",
    "Uh, this doesn't seem like something Starlight and Thorax would do.",
    "Yep. Definitely a Twilight fantasy.",
    "Uh, that probably won't happen.",
    "Okay, that doesn't sound anything like Ember ''or'' Starlight.",

    "Freaky.",
    "Twilight, this is crazy![magic sounds]",

    "Easy, Twilight. It didn't happen.",
    "[voiceover] Are you talking about Twilight? I can't see what you're thinking about.",
    "[voiceover] You mean it was keeping her isolated and alone?",

    "Way to go, Starlight!",
    "Twenty moons from now?",

    "Hey! Twilight and I are about to head to Canterlot. Just checking to see if you need anything before we left.",

    "[blows] [reading] \"Bake a cake with Pinkie Pie,\" \"scrapbook with Applejack,\" \"sew with Rarity...\"",
    "\"Help an animal with Fluttershy,\" \"chillax with Rainbow Dash?\" What is chillaxing?",
    "You know, uh, if you're nervous about your friendship lessons, it's totally okay to say so.",
    "Well, if you were, it'd be\u2014",
    "I think maybe you're missing\u2014",
    "And I thought Twilight was the master of the freak-out.",
    "I had no idea we had spiders in the castle! I'm never sleeping again!",
    "You're really missing the point here.",
    "Told ya.",
    "Told ya.",
    "Yeah! Ever since Starlight messed with it to go back in time and try to change history!",
    "[amplified] Hello, everycreature! I'm your DJ, Scales-n-Tail, spinning your favorite tunes all night long! So welcome to the Fetlock Fet\u2014 I mean, the Amity Ball![students cheering]",
    "Uh, Scales-n-Tail?",
    "[amplified] Oh, yeah, party ponies! It's time to raise the roof and stomp your hoof for the traditional first dance of the night, the Pony Cotillion![classical music plays]",
    "[amplified] Time to shake things up a little! That's right, everycreature! It's the Pony Prance![slider clicking][uptempo pop music plays]",
    "Yona! I'm glad you're back! Everypony wants to learn that crazy dance you did!",
    "[amplified] You asked for it, and DJ Scales-n-Tail is gonna deliver! Everycreature join Yona for... the Yakyakistan Stomp![fast-paced Middle Eastern music plays][loud thumping][students laughing][multiple thumps]",
    "[muffled] Morning, Starlight!",
    "[muffled] Next door on the left!",
    "It's not hard to understand. Most things in the Crystal Empire aren't. Like how I'm a big hero there, for example!",
    "Eh... plus, I've had to help Twilight do a lot of research on Crystallings. Whenever a baby is born in the Crystal Empire, the parents bring it before the Crystal Heart. They get the purest shard of crystal they can find, then pick a crystaller to present the baby to everypony who comes. Then they all share the light and joy they feel, feeding it into the crystal that joins with the Heart, and increases its power! And this is going to be a royal Crystalling, so pretty much the whole empire will show up. That hasn't happened in a millennia!",
    "The energy it uses to protect the Crystal Empire, I guess.",
    "I... didn't help Twilight with that part.[paper rustling]",
    "Gee, Starlight, what's wrong?",
    "Which one?",
    "What's so terrible about that?",
    "You blamed cutie marks and stripped a whole village of theirs, and when Twilight and the others stopped you, you went back in time and almost destroyed Equestria.[poof]",
    "Well, if Sunburst is ''that'' good at magic, maybe he'd appreciate your, uh... [clears throat] exploits. You should talk to Twilight about it. I'm sure she'd want to hear what you have to say.",
    "It's a Crystalling invitation!",
    "Maybe there is! You've already done the work for Starlight's lesson with this list. All we have to do is follow it!",
    "Aye-aye, Princess!",
    "I know you're a little worried about this reunion, but I'm sure Twilight's got everything covered.",
    "Oh, I bet she's taken that into account too. It's all part of the lesson. ''Trust the lesson.''",
    "Oh, yep, it sure is! Now, according to the list, Sunburst's house is\u2014",
    "Nah, it's no big deal.",
    "...and that's how we found the Crystal Heart, defeated King Sombra, and saved the Empire.[Crystal Ponies cheering]",
    "Well, as much as I love reliving my heroic deeds, Starlight and I have an important lesson to do, by order of the Princess of Friendship!",
    "I know you're nervous about seeing Sunburst, but it says right in step 3, to, uh, \"Deal with your fears by facing them, not by putting it off.\"",
    "Wait!",
    "Knocking on the door isn't the next thing on the list!",
    "I know Twilight can be a little nitpicky, but this is your first lesson as her pupil, and it's important that we do it right!",
    "[clears throat] [reading] \"Before they see each other, be sure to highlight the importance of the meeting.\"",
    "I don't know... I mean if we skip it, the whole lesson could go south! And then you might end up taking a giant step backwards instead of forwards! Maybe you'll never be able to learn anything about friendship at all! It's almost like your whole future depends on this moment. [beat] \"Highlight the importance of the meeting\" \u2013 check! I can't believe you wanted to skip that![knocking][long beat][door opens]",
    "Huh. Maybe we should have skipped highlighting the importance of the meeting after all.",
    "Starlight, come on! We have to at least explain what Twilight wants!",
    "I'm sure there's something on Twilight's list that can help here.",
    "Yeah, just look at me! [kisses]",
    "Yeah?",
    "We just need you to get Twilight to remember some of her favorite times with you so this book can record them.",
    "Just to play it safe, let's practice our way first.",
    "Maybe it's better if I do the talking.{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}",
    "I'm sure she just wants everything to be perfect. Isn't that right, Applejack?",
    "Speaking of honesty, what's your favorite time that Applejack was honest, Twilight?",
    "Yup. But you weren't always that way, were ya?",
    "That's another thing I love about you, Applejack. Nopony loves her family more than you do. Right, Twilight?",
    "Ah, just look at me rambling on and on! You brought Twilight here to check the apples, and we haven't even started. Come on, Twilight![door slams]",
    "I think\u2014",
    "I've never heard that story.",
    "Oh, yeah! I don't know how I could've forgotten that. Come to think of it, for a down-to-earth farm pony, you are weird a lot.",
    "Um... \"Apple... Jewel\"?",
    "Uh, because today you wanted Twilight to check over the apples for the coronation, right?",
    "[sighs]",
    "[snickering]",
    "''Think of how much quicker they could wrap up winter with your magic.''",
    "That's my girl, following my advice.",
    "[yelp]",
    "and",
    "There you are, Rarity! That's the last of your bags.",
    "Sure... I'll be a dear... [strains]",
    "Whew, that was close.",
    "Anypony else got a sneaking suspicion we're forgetting something?",
    "Um, there's ''seven'' of us.",
    "''Seven!''",
    "So, what do we do, Twilight?",
    "What about Tirek? He's probably got some magic, too, right?",
    "[belching]",
    "[belching]",
    "[belches] Told ya.",
    "Oh, no! Did I miss the pancakes?![toy squeaks]",
    "I sleep like a baby under that cold, cavernous ceiling.",
    "Really?",
    "Great! I've been meaning to get my claws done! [chews pancake] [with mouth full] Oh, you mean now. [chews]",
    "Hey guys, how do my claws look\u2014''Sweet Celestia!''",
    "Don't worry, I ordered her the super-deluxe mane blow-out! She'll be a while. Man, this place looks terrible!",
    "I dunno. But Twilight's blow-out won't take that long. If she was avoiding the castle before, she'll never set hoof in here now!",
    "Like, forever? But we live here.",
    "Anything for you, Rarity...",
    "Great!",
    "Great?",
    "Great! I mean, no! I mean, uh, I'm not... quite ready to go yet. Uh, why don't we have a massage? I was really hoping to get, uh... this thingy!",
    "[gulps] Yep!",
    "[joints cracking] Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow...",
    "[cracks] Ow! I mean... how... nice is this day? I was hoping we could take the scenic way back.",
    "Come on. Walking is good for post-massage circulation.",
    "We did, didn't we...?",
    "Really?",
    "I, um... I just thought of what I want!",
    "It's a... well, I want a... it's... I kind of need a... a bed!",
    "[scoffs] Everypony knows babies are terrible sleepers. Let's go!",
    "Um... Just right! I'll take it!",
    "Sounds good to meee\u2014I... nn, um, uh, heh... did you hear that? [mimes squeaky springs] Too squeaky! Better keep looking!",
    "Aw, come on! It looks exactly the same! Do you know how hard it was to keep her from coming back here?! I never want to see another dust ruffle as long as I live!",
    "[sighs] I made it for you, Rarity. Why, yes, it is an ice cream house. Chocolate fudge shingles... rocky road garage...[hoof-steps echoing]",
    "Huh? Twilight?",
    "It's the middle of the night! Why are you pacing like this?",
    "Three A.M.?",
    "Eh... I don't understand. What's wrong?",
    "We forgot to celebrate Arbor Day?",
    "And I woke up from an ice cream dream for this...{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}",
    "What is that thing?!",
    "''Destroy Equestria''?!",
    "[yawns] I wish Twilight would go on epic adventures more often. Best night's sleep I've had in weeks.[door opening and closing]",
    "Hey, Twilight. How'd it go with Cerberus?",
    "Hurrh... hu\u2013 [belches]",
    "What's the big deal, it's just a 'lost dog' flyer. I guess the Princess hasn't heard we found Cerberus yet.",
    "A paper cut? Come on, Twilight, you really need to toughen up. Just clean it out and you'll be fine.",
    "[laughs] I dunno, but maybe you ought to give the pacing a rest. You've worn a groove into the floor!",
    "''My'' lectures?",
    "Huh?",
    "Really? So... no matter what happens, you're not gonna move a muscle, huh? Then maybe you won't mind if I... eat an entire tub of ice cream![ice cream splatting]",
    "Mmm! [muffled] So good! [eating noisily]",
    "[chuckles] Stomach ache, huh? That's future Spike's problem.[knocking]",
    "She sure isn't! In fact, she's not gonna move 'til next Tuesday! She thinks it'll prevent the disaster from happening!",
    "[laughing]",
    "Wait, wait, wait, let me try! Whoa-oa\u2013 [belches][whoomph]",
    "I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to! It was a total accident!",
    "You wanna see the future? I might know somepony who can help!",
    "It's Madame Pinkie's place.",
    "Hey Pinkie.",
    "Who cares? As long as I can keep eating ice cream. Sorry, future Spike.",
    "You've been awake too long, Twilight.",
    "Uhh... I don't think we need to sneak around, Twilight. It's not illegal to walk around Canterlot.",
    "I dunno why we have to wear'' these'' things, either.",
    "[sighs] Let's get this over with.[splat]",
    "Uh, Twilight?",
    "Isn't this where we came in?",
    "Oof!",
    "But how do we find the time-stopping spell? There must be a million scrolls here!",
    "Twilight, it's over! It's officially Tuesday morning.",
    "I dunno, Twilight. I don't see any disasters. Looks like a pretty nice day.",
    "I don't get it. If future Twilight wasn't warning you about a disaster, then what was she trying to tell you?",
    "and",
    "Yeah, you do!",
    "That's great! Does that mean there won't be any more late night pacing?",
    "[stomach growls] Ohhh... my stomach... I, I think it's all that ice cream... I thought the stomach ache would be future Spike's problem... but now I ''am'' future Spike. Ohh...",
    "[sighs] I just wanted everything to be perfect. I mean, this was a big deal. But when Discord insists on being involved...",
    "It seemed simple when it started...",
    "[gasps] It's beautiful!",
    "I'm not gonna eat it![poof!]",
    "Because you have a big mouth.",
    "Of course Big Mac asked me to help with his proposal. I'm the most romantic dragon I know.",
    "Spill it! Every detail! Don't leave anything out!",
    "[gasps] You're making a picnic table that matches the shelf you made Sugar Belle for her shop when you had a crush on her, and you're setting up a romantic meal overlooking Sweet Apple Acres?",
    "If you were a hopeless romantic, you'd know that was the only logical choice.",
    "You painted apples to leave around Ponyville with little riddles tied to the stem that will lead her up here to meet you?",
    "Yuh\u2014",
    "Come on. He needs food for the picnic. That was a gimme.",
    "Okay. You finish your table, I'll pick up whatever you need to eat, and Discord will put all the apples in place.",
    "Sugar Belle's gonna love it![thud]",
    "I'll get the food. How long will it take you to place all the apples?",
    "Are you sure you put them in the right spots?",
    "She didn't see the apple! What are we gonna do?",
    "That's not romantic! She needs to discover it!",
    "[sighs][oven timer dings]",
    "Hey, Mrs. Cake. I need to pick up a few things.",
    "Oh, it's kind of important. Maybe I could take some of these off your hooves?[smack!]",
    "All of them? There's... one, two, three, four\u2014",
    "Who needs twenty-one desserts?",
    "Later won't work.",
    "I can't tell you. It's a secret.",
    "[gags] Ugh! Did somepony else bake these?",
    "No reason.[poof!][pop]",
    "Maybe ''I'' can help ''you''. Delivering parchments is my thing. A little dragon breath and fwoosh! We deliver each scroll into each dessert. Then you can help ''me''. Watch!",

    "Discord.[poof!]",
    "You think?[apples chittering]",
    "Apples running everywhere, and she didn't see the poem to get to the hilltop?!",
    "To be honest, I tasted some, and burning them might have been an improvement.",
    "Aah! Uh, hey there, Big Mac. Heh. I bet you're wondering what\u2014[poof!]",
    "I guess this can't get any worse.",
    "Aah! Uh, hey there, Big Mac. Heh. I bet you're wondering what\u2014[poof!]",
    "I guess this can't get any worse.",
    "So the messages that were in the desserts...",

    "We're not ''really'' going! We just needed to get on the train so I can get that rabbit! And when I do, we're ''off!''",

    "And what are ''we'' gonna do?",

    "So what if you stayed out a little longer with your friends? I know they'd be super excited.",

Once Luna was on board, I just had to do ''my'' part and make sure we stuck to Twilight's plan so we'd all get to the throne room at the same time. I knew Shining Armor would let it play out until the last possible second. Then, while everyone was distracted by his gloating, all Luna had to do was float the crown over to me.[beat]",

    "Okay. I think we've had enough of the aloof master of chaos remedies for a broken heart. You know what I do when I have a problem too big to solve? I hide from it! When she can't find you, she'll realize how much she misses you. Plus, if she can't find you, she can't break up with you.",

    "[sighs] That's actually really reassuring.",
    "So, who's gonna give us the tour?",
    "Come on, Twilight. You can do it!",
    "Ha ha! Ya did it! Growing magic, that's number twenty-five. Twenty-five different types of tricks and counting. And I think this is the best trick so far. Hello, Rarity. What's that? Aw, it's nothin', just my awesome mustache. [laughter]",
    "Wait! Aw, rats!",
    "Twenty-five, Twilight. Twenty-five different kinds of tricks and counting. I thought unicorns were only supposed to have a little magic that matches their special talents!",

    "You show her, AJ!",

    "Twilight, would you put down that book and just listen to me?",

    "Oh, twenty five! Yes! And I think I deserve it, too.",
    "Sweet!",

    "I do not get \"all freaked out\" about tests!",

    "Huh? Hm, by highlighting ''everything'', you don't really separate the wheat from the chaff... Or the good from the bad. Hey, I am ''not'' that tall!",

    "No.",
    "No.",

    "I had years worth of friendship lessons ready to go, but when we were captured by Chrysalis, Starlight took charge and really stepped up. I don't think friendship lessons are enough for her anymore.",
    "That's why I had to talk to you. You, of all ponies, would know what to do. I mean, you were me and I was Starlight. But, for now, I need you to pretend you're you and I'm me.",

    "Who ''knows'' what their dynamic would be, Spike?[zaps and torches]",
    "Starlight will ''love'' it in the Dragon Lands. In her letters, Ember said dragons do a lot of fun things. The Feast of Fire, the Dragon Bowl, Claw-chella.",
    "Starlight could be there for a really long time. But then again, not all dragons like ponies as much as Ember does.",
    "What if she didn't realize it was happening?! You just never know, Spike! I just need to think of someplace safe to send her! Someplace safe, someplace safe, someplace safe... I could send her to the Crystal Empire to continue her magical studies with Sunburst![magic sounds]",
    "It'll be perfect! Sunburst's knowledge of magic is only matched by Starlight's abilities.",
    "They could challenge each other into becoming the most talented unicorns Equestria's ever seen!",
    "Of course, the study of magic is a lifelong pursuit, and Starlight could be there for a while, especially once they start attempting the really complicated stuff!",
    "What if they become too ambitious?!",
    "No! Don't do it![whoosh!]",
    "Starlight, noooooo!",
    "But it ''could''! I just don't think I can send her anywhere. What am I gonna do?",
    "Are you laughing at me?",
    "I can't believe you're laughing at me.",
    "What?!",
    "Really?",
    "Princess Celestia, that is so not true. I will ''always'' need you.",

    "Thank you.",
    "[sarcastically] Gee, thanks, Discord.",

    "Starlight, you have proved yourself to be a kind, loyal, strong, honest, and truly magical friend. Just looking around this room at all the new friendships you've made, I know there's nothing more I need to teach you. So we have a second reason to celebrate today.

    "What are you talking about?",
    "Oh, good! 'Cause I'm not ready for that either! Here! I got you this present. It was going to be a \"congrats on getting a medal of honor\" present, but then I was afraid it would have to be a going-away present, but now it's an \"I couldn't be happier you're staying\" present! It fits perfectly over your dresser! I know. I measured.",

    "I have to admit, your skills with magic really are nothing short of amazing. I'm very impressed.",
    "However, it doesn't look like you've tackled any friendship lessons since you met Trixie.",
    "I'm sure.",
    "No time like the present! Spike and I are headed to Canterlot. Princess Celestia wanted me to give her students a quick overview on the history of enchanted objects in Equestria. We'll be back after the presentation, which should be...",
    "Tonight. It's a quick presentation.",
    "You can tackle a friendship lesson today, and we can review your progress when I get back later this evening.",
    "Great! Can't wait. Now, Spike, help me color-code these cards according to time, place, and object.",
    "What is going on?![spider squeaks][brushing]",
    "[sighs] I finally untangled that mess of a spell and got everypony home. It was really powerful stuff. They're gonna feel ''that'' in the morning. Now please try to explain to me how in the name of Celestia things got ''this'' out of control.",
    "I think you might be missing the point here.",
    "What made you think that casting a spell on your friends to do your bidding was even remotely a good idea?",
    "That's because it ''is'' really bad!",
    "Starlight, I'm not mad at you, but I am disappointed. You've been doing so well. I just don't understand how a friendship lesson turned into all of this.",
    "Why?",
    "Baking a cake freaks you out?",
    "Starlight, do you think anypony cares if you can bake a cake?",
    "Was to get to know Pinkie Pie better by doing something she loves. It was a friendship lesson, not a baking lesson.",
    "Now it's time for a pretty advanced friendship lesson. It's called apologizing.",
    "It seems your apology went well.",
    "What do you mean? You've been doing them all day.",
    "Really? But didn't I see you sewing with Rarity?",
    "And you and Applejack did a great job collecting those photos and putting them in the book. Helping animals with Fluttershy, baking with Pinkie Pie \u2013 those sound like your assignments to me. In fact, I think there's just one that you're missing.",
    "Great job, Starlight. Looks like you've completed another friendship lesson. [sighs]",
    "And the Friendship School Teacher of the Month is... Fluttershy!",
    "The award is based on the students' vote. They must really like you.[beat]",
    "Congratulations, Fluttershy!",
    "Next item of business \u2013 I've been looking into a new activity for our friendship classes. Spike?[pages flapping]",
    "Section one-forty-seven, paragraph two states that teamwork is a key part of friendship. And section two-two-nine, paragraph nine says outdoor activity reinforces learning. Add that together, and what do you get?",
    "Mm-mm. A teamwork field trip. Leading it is a Teacher of the Month-type job, so I thought I'd ask\u2014",
    "Of course! Who better to model the importance of working as a team?",
    "Both of you are teamwork experts. If the students see the two of you teaching together, they'll learn even more. I know you've been competitive in the past, but I'm sure you'd never let that get in the way of friendship education.",
    "All right, class. Today you'll learn how important working together is for building a strong friendship.",
    "And what teamwork activity do you two have planned for today?{||",
    "I bet that's exactly what your teachers had in mind. Why don't you start with shed building first?",
    "I'll check in later to see how it's going. Remember to work together!",
    "How's the canoeing... going?",
    "I can't believe this! You're not teaching teamwork! You're competing with each other! I thought you were past that!",
    "The Teacher of the Month wouldn't care about being the Teacher of the Month! I know Fluttershy would be thrilled to see another pony win. That's it! I'm taking over this field trip!",
    "Hmmm... Maybe you two have learned something, after all.",
    "Well...",
    "Fine. But ''I'm'' picking the next activity you two lead. A nature walk. Nopony could possibly argue over that. Right?",
    "Huh? How was the field trip? What did you all learn?",
    "Really...?",
    "Thank you for telling me. I'm so glad to hear your field trip was a success. I'll make sure to schedule another one right away.",
    "[to Rainbow Dash and Applejack] You were actually just competing the entire time, weren't you?",
    "[groans]",
    "As you've all probably noticed, it's been quite some time since the map has sent us on a mission of friendship.",
    "Yes. Since then. But, as part of her studies, Starlight's been assisting me. And together, we think we've come up with a spell that can get it working again![ponies cheering]",
    "Now without further ado...[magic sounds][ponies gasping and oohing]",
    "I won't keep you in suspense any longer. We're bringing one of Ponyville's oldest traditions to our school \u2013 the Fetlock Fete.",

    "[amplified] So, Spike...",
    "[amplified] Uh, right. Scales-n-Tail. [to crowd] Let's get this party started!",
    "And that's why we're giving you this.",
    "From now on, it's the annual Amity Ball Award for Friendship!",
    "Congratulations, you two!",
    "Acceptance, mm-hmm. Altruism, definitely. Starlight, good morning, come in!",
    "Well, I'm not one to dwell on the past, and neither should you. The castle is your home now, and as far as being my pupil goes, I was just trying to figure out what your first friendship lesson should be!",
    "Oh, these are just the A's. After this, I move on to the B's!{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}",
    "Maybe I should pare things down a bit before we go through them. Why don't you join the others in the throne room? They're planning our trip to the Crystal Empire when Shining Armor and Princess Cadance have their baby!",
    "[sighs]",
    "Huh! Funny you should mention it. Because I just narrowed your first friendship lesson down to three options, and one of them is in the Crystal Empire!",
    "I found out that's where the first pony you ever cared about lives!",
    "Of course, that's just one idea. We could also go to Griffonstone. [begins fading out] Making friends with a griffon is a challenge all by itself! Or we could tag along with the CMC's the next time they try to help a pony figure out why they're special...[high-pitched ringing]",
    "[normal] Starlight? Is something wrong?",
    "I know! I guess you were right \u2013 it ''is'' gonna be hard to choose one!",
    "Spike! Come quick![wind blowing]",
    "Shining Armor's a father! I'm an aunt! Well, this settles it! Since we're going to the Crystal Empire, your first friendship lesson is going to be... reuniting with Sunburst!",
    "I'm sure Shining Armor and Princess Cadance will love all our gifts. But I think they're more happy we'll be attending the baby's Crystalling.",
    "Actually, Pinkie, the Crystal Heart is an ancient and powerful relic. Without its magic, the Crystal Empire would be lost to the Frozen North.",
    "Are you kidding? This trip is perfect! Not only do I get to see the baby ''and'' take part in the ceremony that helps maintain the magic of the Crystal Empire, but I'm starting my new pupil off with the most amazing friendship lesson ever! I can't wait!",
    "Oh, trust me. I know what it's like to see old friends. But I'll be right there to help things along. I've broken the whole lesson down into a few easy steps to ensure this reunion goes off without a hitch!",
    "[reading] Step one, head to Sunburst's house and get you two started on the right hoof. Step two, get to the castle with enough time to visit the ba\u2014[thump]",
    "[gasps] Shining Armor!",
    "I didn't know you were meeting us!",
    "Are you all right?",
    "Oh, of course! I don't know what I was thinking! You two probably need all kinds of help! I'm sorry, Starlight, but I guess combining your first lesson with this visit wasn't such a good idea.",
    "I just wish there was a way to do both.",
    "Spike, you're a genius!",
    "Then it's settled! Shining Armor and I will head straight to the castle, and you two can head straight to Sunburst's!",
    "Alright, big brother, let's go see this amazing baby pony!",
    "Come on, big brother. I've met babies before. I expect meeting this one won't be any different. [gasps]",
    "Of course, I could be wrong.",
    "The baby is an Alicorn?!",
    "And I can help keep tabs on her magic!",
    "Shining Armor! Do you have everything you need for the ceremony?",
    "Alright, take it easy. Pinkie can stay here with me and keep an eye on the baby.",
    "Pinkie, hold her still!",
    "We're here!",
    "It's worse than that. Without the Heart, the Crystal Empire's about to be buried under a mountain of ice and snow!",

    "The Smokey Mountains!",
    "Neither have I. And there isn't a lot of information on them. All I could find was this. The Smokey Mountains harbor the most beautiful valley in all of Equestria between its two majestic mountain peaks.",
    "I can't wait to get started! I'm a little nervous since that's all I could find. I usually like to be a bit more prepared.",
    "Yep! I've prepared our things. Snacks, books, blankets, books.",
    "There are a lot of books.",
    "What do ya think our friendship problem's gonna be?",
    "Do you think it'll be a problem about lying?",
    "You're right.",
    "Ooh! Could it be about when two friends just randomly decide to do something together, but they forget to invite the third friend, and the third friend feels left out?",
    "Or where one friend tells another friend's secret after they asked them not to?",
    "Here. Lemme get that.",
    "Sorry I've been a little skiddly-bopty-boo. I just can't believe this is finally happening![pumpkins firing]",
    "Whoa! What in Equestria is happening?[pumpkin firing]",
    "Oh, boy. I'm feeling very unprepared. Where do we even start?[pumpkin firing]",
    "Um, hi. Hello. Excuse us, but what are you doing?",
    "I am Twilight Sparkle, the Princess of Friendship. And I am here to solve your friendship problem.",
    "Well, maybe there ''could'' be if we figure out what the McColts did to make you so mad.",
    "I know what to do. We're gonna talk with these McColts and hear their side of the story. Once we have all the facts, we can put an end to this using reason and rationale.",
    "In the meantime, could you please call off the pumpkining?",
    "Thanks. C'mon, Fluttershy.[knock on door]",
    "There are ''four'' Alicorn princesses in Equestria now. I am Twilight Sparkle, the Princess of Friendship.",

    "Well, actually, that's why we're here \u2013 to solve your problem with the Hooffields.",
    "No! That's not what I meant at all!",
    "We are not on anypony's side. We're here to help you become friends again.",
    "But you ''could'' be! They're just really upset you ruined their farmhouse.",
    "Have you tried meeting at a neutral location, talking about your problems, and really listening to each other?",
    "Well, they'll listen to me. I'm an impartial third party. [voice amplified] Attention, Hooffields and McColts! I'm not on anypony's side, but I can see you're both wasting time and resources on being mean to each other. Ponies are supposed to ''help'' each other and be kind. So let's stop this senseless fighting! [speaking normally] There. That should do it. Ready to go home, Fluttershy?",

    "Well, the good news is we both got called by the map!",
    "No. Well, not exactly.",
    "Ooh!",
    "Have you noticed anypony having a hard time with their friends?",
    "You should tell them. I'm sure they'd appreciate any notes from you.",
    "But they'll never get better if they don't know what to work on.",
    "Classroom portion?",
    "Maybe we ''can'' help!",
    "Absolutely! Between ''your'' flying skills and ''my'' teaching expertise, they could learn a lot! Plus, once they get to know us, they'll be more comfortable coming to us with their friendship problems!",
    "Thank goodness I had time to whip up a few charts on flight patterns and wing symmetry! It's fresh in my mind from when I learned to fly! ''This is so exciting!''",
    "I'm pretty sure their thirst for knowledge will keep them bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.",
    "Hello, students! I'm Twilight Sparkle, and this is Rainbow Dash.",
    "[clears throat]",
    "And we're here to go over basic flying technique.",
    "[clears throat] It ''is'', and we can talk personal records after class, Ms...?",
    "[clears throat] Okay! Let's get back on track. Now, who can tell me the best wing angle to achieve minimal air resistance?",
    "[blows airhorn]",
    "Well, there were a few hiccups, but overall, that went pretty well.",
    "Aw, that's all right. We all have moments where we doubt ourselves.",
    "Oh, well, that is very... kind of you?",
    "Well, he may be full of himself, but I have to admit, Sky is an excellent flyer. He must have shot up two hundred feet!",
    "I guess I didn't even notice Vapor. I was too busy watching Sky.[whooshing]",
    "[gasps] I think you're right! Vapor just created a gust of wind that caught Sky's wing at a forty-five degree angle, propelling him into a flipping loop! [beat] Somepony paid attention in class!",
    "And Vapor's so busy making her friend look good, she's not focused on her own flying at all. [gasps] This must be our friendship problem! And there's only one thing to do!{||",
    "Tell them the truth.|}[distant whooshing]",
    "You don't want to tell them?",
    "But you can't improve if you don't think you have to! Besides, Vapor's keeping a pretty big secret from Sky, and that could lead to trouble!",
    "Actually, she's not the one\u2014",
    "Vapor Trail, we know what you've been doing.",
    "[groans] You've been helping Sky!",
    "Why are you doing this for him?",
    "I understand. But now you're ''both'' in trouble!",
    "What about you?",
    "Starting with telling Sky the truth.",
    "[sighs] Then I guess we'll give Dash's method a shot.",
    "Sounds like my cup of oats.",
    "This is all my fault. If we'd just done things your way, maybe we could have avoided this whole mess.",
    "I have a plan.",
    "Hey, Sky. I thought I might find you here.",
    "No, you're not.",
    "I wasn't a natural at friendship. But with some practice and help from my friends, I got better, and now I'm the Princess of Friendship!",

    "I'm surprised she's not here yet.",
    "And where are Applejack and Fluttershy?",
    "She's bringing an important visitor. That could be part of it.",
    "Yeah, right. That's Discord.",
    "With all due respect, Princess Celestia, ''how could you bring Discord here''?! [clears throat] Your majesty.",
    "I suppose we can just use the Elements of Harmony against him again if it gets out of hand.",
    "Okay, ponies, guess it's time to get started. Let's just hope this releasing spell works.",
    "We'd best keep our elements on at all times 'til further notice.",
    "What do you think you're doing?!",
    "How'd you know about that?!",
    "Well, unless you want us to turn you ''back'' to stone, you'll zap those animals back the way they were, pronto!",
    "If it turns out we need to use our elements against you, I'm sure we can convince Princess Celestia it was for a good reason!",
    "You sure you're okay with this?",
    "You do?",
    "And you really think that'll work?",
    "Okay, but if you need us, all you need to do is whisper \"help\", and we'll be back here with our elements. [to Discord] So watch that goat-legged step of yours, pal!",
    "That's what she said.",
    "And I think I know just the trick.",
    "That's weird. The spell I had in mind isn't in here. Spike, where are the other books I asked you to pull?",
    "I really want to have a reforming spell up and running pronto.",
    "Princess Celestia cast a spell protecting them, remember? Uh-oh.[books thudding]",
    "Princess Celestia didn't cast a spell protecting our books! Everywhere I thought I'd find the reforming spell... [gasps][rumbling]",
    "Fluttershy! Fluttershy, can you hear me?",
    "Fluttershy, what's going on? Are you okay?!",
    "We've come to get you away from Discord! He's just terrible and, from the looks of it, completely out of control!",
    "and",
    "He ''ate'' them?! Ugggghhhh!",
    "And you believed him?",
    "[sighs] Alright. Dinner it is.",
    "Fluttershy thinks this is the way to reform Discord and asked us to give it a chance.[door opens]",
    "Hang on to your elements, girls. It's gonna be a bumpy night.",
    "There's something fishy going on.[splashes]",
    "He fixes this or he goes back to being stone! Princess Celestia will understand![suspenseful pause]",
    "You were right when you said Fluttershy would be the one to find the way to reform Discord. By treating Discord as a friend, she got him to realize that friendship was actually important to him. And something that, once he had, he didn't want to lose.",
    "Yeah! Spike and I are having a cook-off!",
    "I'm glad you're here, Fluttershy, because we're gonna need a second opinion about that.",
    "Uh...",
    "[sighs] That's the last book on ancient ponies, and still no mention of the Mystical Mask.",
    "Yes, and the books on rare diseases, the books on rare plants, and the entire section on bog habitation.",
    "Oh.[music]",
    "[snoring]",
    "Aah![thud]",
    "[sighs] I'm fine. Fluttershy, you know that I want to help Zecora. But I think we'd be a lot better off if we got some sleep. We've been at this for hours.",
    "No problem. I'll grab you a pillow and\u2014",
    "I understand how you feel, but I still think we'd have more luck if we tried again in the morning. Just promise me you'll take a break soon.",
    "[yawns] Good night, Fluttershy.[door closes]",
    "[snoring] 9-by-13-inch pan...[thud!]",
    "[awake] ''Nonstick pans!''",
    "[gasps] You did?!",
    "[gasps deeply] The ancient sorceress from Hayseed Swamp? We studied her at Celestia's school! Are you sure?",
    "Fluttershy, I am so incredibly proud of you for using your research skills to figure this out! But Meadowbrook lived ages ago, and didn't she disappear?",
    "It seems like a long shot, but I guess it's possible.[pyow!]",
    "Whoa, whoa, whoa. We're leaving ''now''?",
    "But Fluttershy, you haven't slept! And that's a long journey!",
    "Can we at least grab some breakfast?",
    "Aw. No sweet potato muffins?",
    "Lead the way, Fluttershy.[thud][circling birdies]",
    "So... [chuckles nervously] where do you think Meadowbrook lived?",
    "I think we might be the only ponies here.[beat]",
    "Anypony who lives in a tree is okay by me.",
    "Or we could try the handle.",
    "Easy to miss.[door opens]",
    "I hope so, but let's not get ahead of ourselves.[loud squeak]",
    "That's exactly what I'm talking about. You're making your excited squeaking noise!",
    "and",
    "Scare ponies or rock creepily in the dark?",
    "Honestly, I would not have guessed it.",
    "Library?! Now we're talkin'![beat]",
    "Oh. Well... [chuckles] Libraries come in all shapes and sizes.",
    "[reading] \"I met a colt today. He pulled my mane, so I put a frog on his head.\" Also not helpful, but I ''do'' kinda want to see where it goes. [grumbles]",
    "[slightly muffled] Are you sure these are necessary?",
    "I said, are you sure these are necessary?",
    "What you can't risk is getting any sicker! If you don't rest, your symptoms will only get worse!",
    "But Fluttershy, as much as Meadowbrook took care of other ponies, I'm sure she also took care of herself.",
    "Are you sure you don't want me to come with you?",
    "[exhales] I'm so glad you're okay. You're still in Meadowbrook's tree.",
    "Uh...",
    "Actually, you've been asleep for three days.",
    "Mm-hmm. You were asleep so long, we were afraid you wouldn't be able to move when you woke up. But thankfully, you just wore yourself down!",
    "Cattail's right. I can't even use magic to calm them down. We'll have to find another way to get the honey.",
    "He's been through a lot these past three days.",
    "Fluttershy, that's brilliant!",
    "Hooves crossed!",
    "I think she's cured now, Fluttershy.",
    "and",
    "We're about to hang our Hearth's Warming dolls if you wanna join us.",
    "I think it's sweet that your families are spending the holiday together.",
    "When Spike and I spent our first Hearth's Warming Eve together, he couldn't wait all night to open his presents! Ever since then, we've always opened them the night before!",
    "To each their own, I suppose.[train whistle blowing]",
    "Please be a yes, please be a yes, please be a yes... Yes! She can make it, she can make it!",
    "I'm finally gonna get to spend some quality time with my sister-in-law! This is the best news ever![knocking on door]",
    "Wow, Fluttershy, that's fantastic!",
    "Have a great time!",
    "Oh, I'm a bit nervous about Cadance's visit!",
    "I know, but I really want her visit to go without a hitch!",
    "Well, the last three times we've seen each other haven't exactly been ''worry-free''.",
    "Exactly. Cadance and I haven't really had a chance to just enjoy being friends again. Which is why it is so important that this visit be about the two of us having some real quality time together.",
    "The timing couldn't be more perfect. For one day only, right here in Ponyville, the Star Swirl the Bearded Traveling Museum! Cadance and I can spend the whole day looking at Star Swirl the Bearded artifacts!",
    "Not counting the drama surrounding which of the bells from his cloak they've chosen to put on display. Spoiler alert it's this one!",
    "Exactly. Just quiet time.[train whistle blows loudly][loud train engine noises][fanfare]",
    "Your Highness.",
    "Boy, have I. Hang on just one second. [to rest of main cast] You guys-",
    "You really are the best friends a pony could ever have. Coming, Cadance!",
    "A whole day to celebrate Star Swirl the Bearded. What could be better?",
    "It sure is!",
    "[yelps]",
    "Discord! What are you doing here?!",
    "Good thinking.",
    "Stay? With me?! Uh, now is not really the best time, though I'm sure you already knew that...",
    "[through gritted teeth] No, that is not what I'm saying.",
    "[sighs] Guess we don't have much choice.",
    "Need anything else?",
    "[sighs]",
    "Alright, this is ridiculous!",
    "There must be some way to just cure you! There has to be a spell or remedy in one of my books!",
    "I suppose you have a good reason you didn't bother to get this flower as soon as you realized you were sick?",
    "So where exactly are Cadance and I headed?",
    "Doing okay there?",
    "I'm really sorry about this. All I wanted was to have some peaceful quality time together.",
    "This is the top. But where is that flower? Oh. Come on, if we hurry, we can still have some time together.[cracking]",
    "[straining]",
    "Phew! Let's get Discord and this flower back home, then all our problems are solved-",
    "[screaming]",
    "Get your coils off my sister-in-law![thud]",
    "[yelps]",
    "[screams]",
    "Thanks!",
    "[gasps][magic zapping, Tatzlwurm roaring]",
    "Just... a little... more!",
    "[panting] Are you okay?",
    "Then let's get Discord back to Ponyville, make that elixir, and finally get a chance to spend some quality time together.",
    "You... were... faking?!",
    "We're listening.",
    "I don't even know where you li-",
    "I have ''never'' considered myself t-",
    "I'm not more-",
    "He didn't?!|",
    "It is?",
    "I think it's pretty clear that my visit with Cadance didn't go quite the way I expected. But in the end, I realized that when you're with a good friend, even the most chaotic day can end up being a great experience that brings you closer. Wouldn't you agree, Discord?",
    "''No!''",
    "So glad you've finally made it!",
    "Oh, haven't you heard? The release of the next book got pushed another two months.",
    "The publisher just said author A.K. Yearling won't be able to finish the book for another two months. Cupcakes?",
    "I'm just as big a fan as you! In fact, I'm the one who first introduced you to the books, ''remember''?",
    "A.K. Yearling just might be my favorite author. I know everything about her. Where she grew up, where she studied literature, where she wrote the first ''Daring Do'' book...",
    "Uh... no, though I could probably find out somehow. Why?",
    "Hmm, I don't know... what she probably wants most of all is respect for her privacy.",
    "Mmh... I suppose you're right...",
    "You see what I mean? Why would she live in this remote part of Equestria except to keep folks from intruding on her privacy? We should respec\u2014",
    "Wait! Oh no. What happened?",
    "Oh no! What if something terrible happened to her?",
    "We didn't do this! We swear!",
    "We're awfully glad to see you're alright.",
    "Rainbow Dash, a minute please! A.K. Yearling has made it pretty clear that she wants to be left alone. We need to respect her wishes!",
    "A.K. Yearling ''is'' Daring Do!",
    "A.K. Yearling and Daring Do are one and the same! My mind is officially blown!",
    "I know, but she refused! I can't believe it! The ''real'' Daring Do and the ''real'' Caballeron!",
    "You heard her! She says she works alone!",
    "True, but in book four, she defeated Ahuizotl and secured control of the Amulet of Atonement, dispelling the dark magic of the Ketztwctl Empress, and thus protecting the basin with the Radiant Shield of Razdon!",
    "But are you forgetting that the Rings were scattered to the four corners of Tenochtitlan, thus rendering the dark enchantment powerless?",
    "[sighs] Okay, but sounds to me like we're in ''way'', way, way over our heads. We're going to need a carefully thought out plan...",
    "''That's not a plan!''",
    "Quick, where does it hurt?",
    "Dash, I'm sure whatever you did was an honest mistake.",
    "Look, there is more going on here than meets the eye. In every ''Daring Do'' book, there always is! We can't turn our backs on her!",
    "Perhaps. But she might need it anyway.",
    "It's fine to look up to Daring Do, but you've put her so high up on a pedestal, you can't even see your own worth anymore! She's in the fortress, and we're here, and we wouldn't be who we are if we didn't go in after her! And neither would you! So, are you with us, or not?[underwater sounds]",
    "Wow, Applejack! Are you sure you've never managed a concert before?",
    "And thanks to Pinkie's connections organizing the Ponypalooza Rock Concert, we've got quite a lineup for the Helping Hooves Music Festival.",
    "What is it, Pinkie?",
    "Ahhh...",
    "[gasps][poing]",
    "''Rara?!''",
    "Good evening, everypony! Welcome to opening night of the Helping Hooves Music Festival! Now it is my great honor to introduce you to our headlining act \u2013 Countess Coloratura![crowd cheering]",
    "No problem at all, Applejack. I'm glad the goal is lunchtime. All this hard work is making me hungry.",
    "Puh-lease, Spike. You've been lounging on my back all morning while ''we'' worked.",
    "[stomach grumbles] [laughs nervously] Eh, I guess we better get some food.",
    "[licks lips] Oh Spike, that looks delicious!",
    "''Spike''.",
    "It's a letter from Princess Celestia.",
    "Wow, great! I've never been to the gala. Have you, Spike?",
    "Aw, come on Spike. A dance would be nice.",
    "Oh, well in that case, would you like to\u2014",
    "Yeah, but\u2014",
    "Girls, these are ''my'' tickets, ''I'll'' decide who gets it, thank you very much. Whoever has the best reason to go should get the ticket, don't you think?",
    "Oh my, those were all pretty good reasons, aren't they? [stomach rumbles] [chuckles] Listen to that, I am starving. I don't know about you, but I can't make important decisions on an empty stomach, so I'll, uh, think about it over lunch and get back to you two, okay?",
    "I don't know Spike, but I ''really'' can't think straight when I'm hungry, so where should we eat?[crash]",
    "Um, actually\u2014",
    "Uh\u2014",
    "Uh, listen guys, I haven't decided who to give the extra ticket to.",
    "Gee, Fluttershy, it sounds... beautiful...?",
    "Rainbow Dash! Were you following me?",
    "Applejack, were you following me too?",
    "",
    "Girls, there's no use in arguing.",
    "Eh! This is my decision, and I'm gonna make it on my own, and I certainly can't think straight with all this noise... [stomach rumbles] not to mention hunger. Now go on, shoo.[ponies grumble]",
    "And don't worry, I'll figure this out... somehow.",
    "[sighs] Spike, what am I gonna do? All five of my best friends have really good reasons to go to the gala. Applejack, or Rainbow Dash? Pinkie Pie or Fluttershy, Rarity... Oh, who should go with me? [stomach rumbles]",
    "I CAN'T DECIDE!",
    "Oh. I would love a daffodil and daisy sandwich.",
    "What do you think, Spike?",
    "I ''mean'' about the Gala and the ticket and who I should take.",
    "Spike, ''listen''. How do I choose? And when I do choose, will the other four be mad at me? I mean, I could give up my ticket and give away two, but that would still leave three disappointed ponies. What if I\u2014",
    "Oh thank you. This looks so good. I'm sure everything will be much clearer once I eat.[ponies galloping]",
    "It's not raining...[thunderclap]",
    "What's going on?",
    "Rainbow Dash, what are you doing?",
    "Rainbow, you're not trying to get extra consideration for the extra ticket by doing me extra special favors, are you?",
    "Uh-huh.",
    "Rainbow, I am ''not'' comfortable accepting unwanted favors, so I'd appreciate it if you close up that rain cloud right now.",
    "That's better. [groans]",
    "No, really?",
    "[shaking] Heh heh, oops, sorry.",
    "Uh...",
    "Ugh, Rarity, ow, this really isn't fixing it. I mean, thank you but, ooh, ''that's too tight''.",
    "Uh, yeah, it is kinda pretty, isn't it?",
    "[giggles] Oh, Spike.",
    "Wait, the ''Grand''\u2014",
    "I see what's going on. You're just buttering me up so I give you the extra ticket. Well it's not gonna work. You're going to have to wait for my decision just like everyone else. Now if you'll excuse me, I've been trying all day just to get some ''lunch''.",
    "You've got to be kidding me!",
    "[stomach grumbles]",
    "No. ''No.'' I don't know who I'm giving the ticket to, and all these favors aren't making it any easier to decide. In fact, I'm less sure now than I was this morning. Ugh!",
    "Ugh, I never thought being showered with favors would be so ''aggravating''.",
    "[gasp] Fluttershy, not you too?",
    "It's summer.",
    "You're not doing this for the ticket, are you?",
    "No, no, no! Well, this was all very nice of you and Angel, but I'm not accepting any extra favors until I've made my final decision, so I'm going to have to ask you to leave.",
    "At least the other ponies ''tried'' to be subtle about the ticket.",
    "We're... gonna... ''run''![Benny Hill-esque music][ponies offer favors][offscreen I'll do your taxes!][offscreen Where is she? Where did she go? She's disappeared.]",
    "I didn't even know it was gonna happen. Now quick, lock the doors![doors closing, lights clicking]",
    "Phew. Yaaaargh! I can't decide, I just can't decide! It's important to all of you and I just can't stand to disappoint any of you, and giving me gifts and doing me favors won't make any difference, because you're all my friends and I wanna make you all happy and I can't, I just ''can't''!",
    "Spike, take down a note. ''Dear Princess Celestia,''''I've learned that one of the joys of friendship is sharing your blessings, but when there's not enough blessings to go around, having more than your friends can make you feel pretty awful. So, though I appreciate the invitation, I will be returning both tickets to the Grand Galloping Gala.''",
    "''If my friends can't all go, I don't wanna go either.''",
    "Nope. I've made up my mind. Spike, you can send the letter now.",
    "It's okay, girls. I couldn't possibly enjoy myself without my best friends there with me...",
    "...So I would rather not go at all.",
    "A letter from the princess? That was fast.",
    "Now we can all go!",
    "[stomach rumbles] [laughs nervously]",
    "Great question, Spike! And the answer is...[bell rings]",
    "...going to bed! Brains need eight hours of sleep to perform at optimum levels!",
    "The answer is...[bell rings]",
    "...yes! Ask me another one.",
    "Another question! I want to stay in the zone. That way, I can sleep in the zone! Wake up in the zone! And be totally in the zone tomorrow![beat]",

    "...yes!",
    "The answer is...[bell rings]",
    "...''yes!''",
    "The answer is...[bell rings]",
    "...good night! And yes!",
    "I'm glad you decided to come watch your first Trivia Trot, Spike. I hope the rules aren't too confusing.",
    "[laughs] The Trot is a little more involved than that. Let's start with the first category of rules. [reading] \"Categories. Rule one Each category must be categorically designated and thoroughly researched in all categorical...\"",
    "\"...participating in Trivia Trot.\" And that wraps up rule forty-one point six. Of course, the exception to that \u2013 rule forty-one point six A \u2013 is interesting itself because\u2014",
    "Ooh! I can't wait to see who my partner's gonna be!",
    "Rule twenty point one six B, Spike. To keep things fair, the teams are randomly selected.",
    "And based on the regular attendees, I've charted every potential teammate's strengths and weaknesses, plus my percentage of winning with each one!",
    "[laughs] You could never let me down, Spike. But I'm glad you're watching, too. I'm going to need all the support I can get for win number three![door opens][indistinct conversations]",
    "Everypony here has a different area of expertise, so it really is anypony's game. But yes!",
    "Rule thirty-seven point two C. No back-to-back categories. But I think Fluttershy was joking.[door opens]",
    "Pinkie Pie?!",
    "[panicked muttering]",
    "I hadn't anticipated Pinkie Pie as a potential player! She's never played before! My chart is completely off! I have no way to predict what'll happen, and unpredictable is not good for a Trivia Trot three-peat!",
    "Spike! This has nothing to do with being the Princess of Friendship! And this is ''not'' just a game! This! Is! ''Trivia Trot!''[tapping]",
    "[gasps] It's starting! I have to reevaluate my chart! Spike, I need you to find the part on matchups! Can you look outside?[teleportation zap][door opens]",
    "Granny's about to call out the fifth team. Sunburst gave me the highest chance of winning, but he's been paired with Cranky Doodle!",
    "At least Rainbow Dash and Applejack aren't together. Team Apple-Dash is basically unstoppable.",
    "And apart they'll spend all their energy trying to one-up each other, so that only helps my chances.",
    "Eh, not every team is a threat, but there aren't many ponies left.",
    "Maud and Mudbriar have been paired together every week. It's a statistical improbability! Which would be fine if they weren't so good.[sizzling]",
    "[deep gasp] Oh, no! According to my calculations, the only pony who could really threaten my winning streak is...!",
    "Yeah. Great.",
    "Pinkie, I'm glad you're excited, but tonight's game is special. I could be the first pony ever to win three consecutive Trots in a row. And I'm really hoping I do.",

    "Let's get this back to my library. I'm sure we'll figure out what happened in no time.",

    "Star Swirl and the rest of the Pillars sacrificed themselves to save Equestria.",
    "I think I understand Star Swirl's spell!",
    "I know I've finished one of Star Swirl's spells before, but this one was on a whole different level! Was it an explosion of magical feedback? An evocation? A kind of incantation? It's Star Swirl, so the possibilities are endless! And once Starlight set me on the right track with his crazy hornwriting \u2013 [laughs, snorts] I mean, he was a genius, so I guess we can forgive a little messiness \u2013 I went through the journal again, and it's amazing!",
    "Only how Star Swirl and the other Pillars sent the Pony of Shadows to limbo!",
    "They used their magic to open a portal between worlds \u2013 to limbo \u2013 and pulled the Pony of Shadows inside.[poof!]",
    "I made more![clatter]",
    "Star Swirl thought the only way to trap the Pony of Shadows in limbo was for the Pillars to take him there.",
    "The thing is, I think I can get them out.",
    "First of all, you opened portals through time. And second of all, Star Swirl wrote the spell you used to do it. If he'd been here, he could have stopped it. Equestria would be safer with him in it. We have to save him.",
    "That's the thing about limbo. It isn't one place or another. It's in between, so time stands still. If we can pull them out, it'll be like they never left. I actually built another model to demonstrate\u2014",
    "If I'm right, we need to find items that are connected to the Pillars in some way.",

    "You and the others have been trapped in limbo for over a thousand years, but I figured out how to get you ho\u2014",

    "I'm so glad you could make it, Fluttershy. It wouldn't be the same without you.[ding!]",
    "Oh, you and your tender loving care of little animals. I just know Princess Celestia is gonna love that about you. I mean, I hope she will... I mean, of course she will!",
    "Oh, it's not that. I just want the princess to approve of my friends.",
    "And read about you in my letters. But this is the first time she's spent any real time with you. I want everypony to make a good impression.",
    "Oh...",
    "[sigh] Well, Spike, I don't know for sure how things went with the princess, but at least no big disasters happened.",
    "Hi, Fluttershy! I just wanted to drop by and say thank you so very much for making such a good impression on the princess today... [gasp] What is Celestia's pet doing here?!",
    "Oh no. Nononononono''no''! This is bad.",
    "But... but... she doesn't belong to you!",
    "Without telling anypony?! Without asking permission?!",
    "I know you had good intentions, but you have ''got'' to return the princess's pet!",
    "If we hurry, we can put her back before anypony even realizes she's missing. [gasp]",
    "Really? You don't say! [nervous laughter]",
    "[cough]",
    "[cough]",
    "and",
    "It's that dry night air?",
    "Well... day air's even drier. You guards better be on your way if you're gonna find the princess's missing pet. Philomena, was it? Thank you ever so much for keeping me in the loop. Bye! [pants] Phew... What are you doing?!",
    "We can't ''now''!",
    "You have no idea what the princess is gonna do if she finds you're the one who took her pet, do you?!",
    "Well... no. But it can't be anything good. She might banish you from Equestria. Or throw you in a dungeon. Or banish you and then throw you in a dungeon ''in'' the place that she banishes you to!",
    "Okay. Granted that probably won't happen, but do you wanna take any chances?",
    "That's very noble of you. I'll write to you when you're banished. Unless I'm banished to somewhere there's no post office. Then you'll have to write to me. Deal?",
    "Did you give her any kind of medicine?",
    "[groan] Then you have to ''make'' her take it. You can't be such a pushover, Fluttershy! You need to show this patient who's the boss. Make her straighten up and fly right!",
    "No excuses! Done. Okay, what else?",
    "There you go.",
    "Tough love, baby. You want her to get well, don't you?",
    "Next!",
    "One step ahead of you.",
    "What's this soup over here? Smells delicious.",
    "Oh, she'll eat it, all right.",
    "Hey! Where are you going?",
    "Beg your pardon!",
    "Yes, your Majesty, there's been a terrible accident.",
    "No, Princess. Fluttershy didn't know any better. It was ''my'' fault.",
    "But you were only trying to help.",
    "Will ya let me do this? She'll go easier on me.",
    "No, it's ''my'' fault!",
    "Fluttershy really did do everything she could to try to take care of Philomena for you.",
    "Should I write you a letter about that lesson, Princess?",
    "Do you have time to tell us what happened, Rainbow Dash?",
    "Everypony knows you're a great flyer, Rainbow Dash, but so are the rest of the Wonderbolts. It might be more challenging than you think.",
    "We know you're probably tired, Rainbow Dash, but Pinkie wanted to throw you a real party.",
    "Why would they call you that?",
    "Urgh.",
    "Rarity's right. Why don't you think of the Wonderbolts like us? We're a team, but we all stand out in different ways.",
    "Rainbow Dash is a pretty resilient pony. I'm sure she's shaken off her tough first day and turned it around by now!",
    "I thought the Wonderbolt Reserves were here to help.",
    "That was amazing! She's doing great!",
    "Hey. Rainbow Dash. We just wanted to check on you. Are you doing okay?",

    "Ugh, never mind her. She's just being Pinkie Pie.",
    "Pinkie Pie? What in the wide, wide world of Equestria are you up to?",
    "Actually, Pinkie, I haven't the slightest idea.",
    "Oh, Pinkie, it's not gonna rain. Why, there's barely even a cloud in the-ugh![frog croaks]",
    "Of course you did.",
    "Oh, really? Did your ''Pinkie Sense'' tell you that, too?",
    "C'mon, Spike, let's continue our practice session where there's a little less commotion.",
    "Oh, come on. She said that something would fall, and a frog just ''happened'' to fall right around the same time. A coincidence, nothing else to it.",
    "Oh, Pinkie, please. Nothing else is gonna fa-aaah!",
    "Oh, ''please''.",
    "Honestly, Spike, she did not. Two coincidences in a row like this may be ''unlikely'', but it's still easier to believe than twitchy tails that predict the future.",
    "Oh, wait. Don't tell me you believe in this stuff, too?",
    "Huh? [chuckles] A bath? This thing keeps on getting more ridiculous by the minute![splash]",

    "''Huge''! For one thing, [clears throat] magic is something you study and practice. It only happens when you ''decide'' to do it, and it's meant to make something specific that you choose to happen, happen. With you, uh, it makes no sense at all!",

    "Urgh! This is ridiculous. This can't be happening. This makes no sense. I ''have'' to figure this out.[frog croaks][frogs croaking]",
    "Ah!",
    "Honestly, Spike, don't you know better than to sneak up on ponies?",
    "[gasp] No! I'm doing scientific research. I'm observing Pinkie Pie, scientific name Pinkius Pieicus, in its natural habitat.",
    "There's something fishy going on with the whole twitchy prediction thing, and I'm getting to the bottom of it. So, shh. Come on, Pinkius Pieicus is on the move.",
    "Hm... Itchy nose...",
    "Aha! ''That'' makes no sense. See? She's hiding like something's about to fall from the sky, but a ''twitchy tail'' means something's gonna fall from the sky, ''not'' an itchy nose.[swarm of bees buzzing]",

    "...perhaps conclusively, that\u2014",

    "Ow! Ouch! Ow! [whimper]",
    "Smelling a flower.",
    "Probably that the flower smells ''good''. Wait. I'm getting something. Ear flop, eye flutter, knee twitch.",

    "Okay, take this down twitchy tail.",
    "Hush, Spike! We can't let Pinkie know we're here, remember?",
    "Ugh, Spike honestly, you're overreact\u2014[crack][clang][smash][crash]",
    "Ugh!",
    "You mean you knew all along?! Why didn't you tell me?",
    "Urgh!",
    "Calm down, everypony. All we know right now is that Pinkie Pie just got a case of the shivers. That's all.",
    "I ''don't''. I just want to be there to see the look on Pinkie's face when we find out nothing's wrong.",
    "''Cold''? Need a jacket or something?",
    "Will you two ''stop''? She's fine, I'm sure of it.",
    "Sorry, I know it's not nice to gloat but... Aha! I told you there was nothing to worry about, and I was right. Pinkie Pie said whatever she was shuddering about was a [cough] doozy, and [cough] and the only [cough] doozy here is how right I am.",
    "Pinkie's made a lot of predictions today but [cough] ugh, what is that smell? But what we've shown here is that there's no point in believing [cough] in anything you can't see for yourself.",

    "Huh?",

    "The fight. I can't fight it anymore. I don't understand how, why, or what, but Pinkie Sense somehow... makes sense. I don't see how it does, but it just does. Just because I don't understand doesn't mean it's not true.",
    "Yup, I guess I do.",
    "What? What is?",
    "Oh, good, Spike, you're here. Take a letter.",

    "''I am happy to report that I now realize there are wonderful things in this world you just can't explain, but that doesn't necessarily make them any less true. It just means you have to ''choose'' to believe in them, and sometimes it takes a friend to show you the way.''",

    "''Ugh''... what a dream... Curses, schmurses. Whoa! [chuckle] Maybe Zecora cursed my hair. [Laughs nervously and then gasps] Or she cursed my horn!",

    "I said a ''real'' reason. Something that points to something ''real''.",

    "Fluttershy? Are you okay? Is there something wrong with you? Would you care to tell us? So... you're not going to tell us? Yes you're not, or yes you will?",

    "What have you done with Apple Bloom?",
    "We're onto you Zecora. I didn't want to believe that you cursed us, but the evidence is overwhelming!",
    "You ruined my horn!",
    "''Where is Apple Bloom!?''",
    "Because Zecora is an evil enchantress who cursed us and was gonna cook you up into soup!",
    "Apple Bloom, sweetie. You can't just stand there and tell me this isn't a curse.",
    "I think what she's saying is that when we ran in to save Apple Bloom, we ran into the poison joke. All our problems are just little jokes it played on us.",
    "But the cauldron... The Apple Bloom soup?",
    "But I tried to find a cure in all my books and couldn't find anything. What book has this natural remedy?",
    "Actually, I do have this book, but I didn't look inside because the title was so... Weird. ''Supernaturals Natural Remedies and Cure-alls That Are Simply Super''. I...I... I'm so sorry, Zecora. I had the answer the whole time, if only I had bothered to look inside.",

    "I'm Twilight Sparkle, and you must be...",
    "Mayor, I hope you don't mind my asking, but is there a reason your town is... faded?",

    "The truth?",
    "Think of all the papers I could be grading!",
    "Mr. Mayor, what kind of magic did you use on the Rainbow Generator?",
    "Hmmm. If I could find out the type of magic you used, I might be able to reverse the spell.",
    "We'll do whatever we can to bring back your Rainbow Festival.",
    "Mmm, it might be tough, but we have a little experience bringing ponies together.",
    "The biggest challenge is getting your town interested in a Rainbow Festival when everything's so... gray. I think if we can bring the color back, it'll solve everything.",
    "Rainbow Dash, I need your help.",
    "If magic caused this, maybe magic can solve it.[music][magic sounds]",
    "[sighs] Oh, I was afraid of that. I've never seen any magic like ''this'' before.",
    "[sighs] Thanks for trying. I guess I need to do more research.[whooshing]",

    "A prism curse? An erasure spell? None of these are big enough to make a whole town lose its color on their own! Ugh! Unless...",
    "Huh?",
    "Mayor Skies.",
    "What is all this?",
    "The pictures! They're in color!",
    "Whoa. The festival was really something, wasn't it?",
    "Right. The mayor's magic in the generator caused the colors to go.",
    "There's something strange about this. I just can't put my hoof on it. If only the Generator hadn't been destroyed...",
    "[gasps]",
    "Wow!",
    "Mind if I borrow this?[music]",
    "Mr. Mayor. [grunts] I hope you don't mind, but\u2014",
    "My theory is that the Generator magnifies whatever magic it uses, makes it stronger. So if we could rebuild it and use one of the reversal spells I just read about, it could work to bring color back to the town!",
    "Thank you so much for your help.",
    "Now we need to test it.",
    "Might be best to make sure it works first. I'd hate to disappoint him.",
    "In a moment, Applejack. This is important.",

    "Ooh! Everything looks delicious!",
    "[gasps] Kerfuffle, this is amazing! Everypony, you've done great work. [sighs] I just wish I could've done my part. I hate to admit it, but I'm stuck. I don't know how to make the town's color come back.",
    "But how? It wasn't the Generator. Which means something ''else'' must have drained the town's color in the first place! I have to get back to the library!",
    "I thought so! Look. In the second photo, when the Generator goes off, this pony is walking away. But on the ''third'' photo, when all the color's gone, he's back where he was. Which means...",
    "Maybe we should just show him.",
    "These photos from the library explain everything. Once I realized they were out of order, it proved that the town's colors got dim ''before'' you turned on the Generator.",
    "It's called \"Hopeless Magic\". Everypony was already giving up each other, losing hope. Then, when the Generator blew up, it must have been the last straw. It took all the hope out of the town for good, along with the color. But now there's a different kind of magic. Of everypony coming together again. Just the way you wanted it, Mayor.",
    "And we'd better get it started. This town's been waiting long enough.",

    "Like I said, everything in the past affects the future, even the tiniest act. And what you're doing leads here. I know I can't stop you, but I thought showing you this might change your mind.",
    "I don't know what happened that led you to make your village without cutie marks, and I'm sorry my friends and I had to take it away.",
    "Where are we?",
    "That's ridiculous. A cutie mark can't take your friends away.",

    "So try again! Make new friends! And if something that you can't control happens that changes things, work through it together! That's what friendship is! And it's not just ''my'' friendships that are important to Equestria! Everypony's are! When yours ended, it led us here. But just imagine all the others that are out there waiting for you if you just give them a chance!",
    "I guess it's up to you to make sure they don't.[whoosh][paper rustling][boom][magic zaps][magic zaps][thumps][magic zaps]",
    "Yeah, Spike. It looks like we're home!",
    "Actually, it's kind of a long story.[muffled voices]",
    "I think it's more than that. Friendship connects all of Equestria, and undoing one group of friends made its magic less powerful.",
    "She obviously has more talent for magic than almost anypony I've seen. My magic couldn't stop her. I had to convince her to stop on her own. Once I realized that, everything fell into place.",
    "Actually, I kind of have something else in mind.[door opens]",
    "I've been thinking a lot about how badly Equestria fared without just one group of friends. Because even when one friendship dies, the results can be disastrous.",

    "Luna![crystals cracking]",
    "[yelping]",
    "But that means the Tantabus could be turning every dream in Ponyville into a nightmare!",
    "Hmm... What if everypony in Ponyville were having ''one'' dream?",
    "[gasps] Princess Luna did it!",
    "Princess, what's wrong?",
    "Then you're in luck.",
    "Fluttershy's right! We've all got to work together to stop it from escaping!",
    "And not just any! This is ''your'' dream! Anything you can do in your dreams, you can do now!",
    "But it's not enough![Tantabus roaring]",
    "I think it's feeding off your guilt, Princess Luna!",
    "But that means you might just be the key to stopping all this!",
    "But look at what ''you're ''doing! Nightmare Moon would've wanted the Tantabus to turn Equestria into a nightmare! ''You're'' doing everything you can to stop it! Don't you see? That proves you're not the same pony you were then! Everypony who knows you knows that Nightmare Moon is in the past! We all trust you, Luna! Do you trust ''us ''enough to believe we're right?[Tantabus growling]",
    "[gasps] Luna did it!",
    "Luna created the Tantabus to punish herself! The worse she felt, the more power it had! But once she finally forgave herself for what Nightmare Moon did...",
    "C'mon, Fluttershy, it'll be fun!",
    "But Fluttershy, the great dragon migration happens only once in a generation! Do you really wanna pass up a chance like that?",

    "Well... yeah!",
    "[gasps]",
    "[hushed] I don't see any dragons.",
    "[hushed] No, I don't think so. We're just a little early, and I'm glad we are. This way, we can watch every moment of the migration without bringing any unwanted attention to ourselves!",
    "[hushed] You look very nice, Rarity, but could you maybe look nice down here in the trench with us?",
    "Wow, amazing!",
    "Or act like them.",
    "Uuugh! I don't know! For the last time, Spike, you were given to me as an egg. I don't know who found you or ''where'' they found you.",
    "I'm sorry, Spike.",
    "Oh, Spike. Why don't we do some late-night research? See what we can find out.",
    "Of course! I'm sure we can find something.",
    "Nothing. Nothing in this one either!",
    "I know! It's hard to believe, but ponies know next to nothing about dragons. Apparently they're too rare and too scary to try to talk to or study!",

    "We know.",
    "Well then, I guess this is goodbye, Spike. We can't wait to hear about it when you return.",

    "[deep voice] Aheh... yeah... hilarious.",
    "[gasps] How can he just throw that away?! That letter could be something important!",
    "I know, I know!",
    "There's no reason to disrespect Princess Celestia that way!",
    "Let's go! [deep voice] I challenge Spike to a tail wrestle!",
    "Oof![pinching noise]",
    "[hushed] Spike's on his own this time.[dragons cheering]",
    "Forever?!",
    "Oh no, this is terrible!",
    "No, Rainbow Dash, this is all ''my'' fault! I encouraged him to go!",
    "[yelps] Rainbow Dash, stop! We can't fly!",
    "Well, we're just gonna have to hoof it!",
    "That's right!",
    "Nyuh![crash]",
    "[yelps]",
    "Of course. What are friends for?",
    "First lesson of the day, we very carefully set the table ''without'' using magic, so that\u2014 Yikes![silverware clattering]",
    "Did you...?! How? When? ''What?!''",
    "I said no magic. You were supposed to do it by hoof so I could work in a friendship lesson.",
    "Well, if you ''hadn't'' used magic, you'd have heard me say, uh... this plate represents your head, this spoon is your heart, and the knives... are sharp! Always be careful with knives. [sigh] The metaphors make more sense when you're actually setting the table.",
    "I just want to make sure you're ready for this dinner. Princess Celestia will be joining us tomorrow night to see how the friendship lessons are going!",
    "Well, the whole point is for you to bring a new friend. That way, the princess will see for herself just how far you've come. ''And'' how good a teacher you have.",
    "That's the best part! You have to make a new friend!",
    "Starlight!",
    "Soup spoon, salad fork, pasta spoon, strawberry pick. I'm beginning to think that after friendship, the greatest magic of all is proper silverware placement! [giggles]",
    "That's fantastic news!",
    "Great!",
    "Powerful?",
    "Trixie?!",
    "You could say that.",
    "So, um, what brings you to Ponyville?",
    "Starlight? A moment? Over here? [hushed] I know I said make friends with ''anypony'', but, well, with Trixie's past, and your past, I'm not sure she's the best... first friend.",
    "Of course. It's just... She wasn't the nicest pony.",
    "[sighs] You're right. I trust you. Just be back in time for the dinner.",
    "I hope not. [sighs]",
    "Pssssssst! Pssst! ''Psssssst''! Shhhhhh!",
    "[hushed] So, how's it going with your new friend?",
    "Because you know, if it isn't working out for any reason, I could introduce you to my friend here.[bush rustling]",
    "No, no! You can come out now![dubstep playing]",
    "You like music, right? DJ Pon-3'd be the perfect friend for tonight's incredibly important dinner with Celestia. You know, if you decide to make a last-minute change. Heh.",
    "[nervously] Who can really say who said what? I know I can't! [to DJ Pon-3] Can you?[dubstep fades out]",
    "Starlight, I'm just trying to look out for you.",
    "That's kind of what I'm afraid of. Oh! What about her?[thump]",
    "But do you really think Trixie's the one to help you with that?",
    "Oh! Now he'd be perfect!",
    "Starlight Glimmer should be here, heh, any minute, heh. Any minute now... [nervous laugh] [forced] How about I introduce everyone? Our friendship lessons are going so well! She made three new friends! She has such great taste in friends. I don't know where she would've learned that! [nervous laugh]",
    "[nervously] Ha-ha, Cranky Doodle! You're so funny! If you'll excuse me, I'm gonna check the kitchen. Maybe she got lost amongst the, uh... artichokes! [nervous laugh]",
    "Starlight? Has anyone seen Starlight Glimmer? I'm looking for her! ''Trixie.''",
    "Ahem? You just decided to skip our dinner without telling me? Are you aware that, at this very moment, Princess Celestia is waiting for you at a table with exquisite silverware placement?!",
    "This is exactly why I didn't want you to make friends with Trixie.",
    "Well, you won. I hope you're happy!",
    "Trixie?",
    "Starlight, when I first came to Ponyville, Princess Celestia gave me room to make my own decisions and my own friends. I need to give you the same freedom. I shouldn't have tried to pick and choose your friends for you. Just like me, you have to make your own decisions and your own friends.",
    "From what I've seen, she's the real thing.[fuse lights]",
    "But it's not my place to judge. It's all up to you.[manticore roars][fuse hisses]",
    "Trixie!",
    "I was wrong. I'm sorry. And I have to hand it to you. I could never have pulled off a trick like that.",
    "About what?",
    "Oh, that. Actually, I'm feeling pretty good. We've all faced so much and come out okay. I know we're up to the challenge of keeping Equestria safe and happy. There's nothing we can't handle together. Which reminds me...",
    "A new position I created for you. You've been at my side for every step of this journey. Knowing I had you to count on gave me the strength I needed to grow and succeed. I wouldn't be here without you.",
    "I was hoping you'd say that. Because now that my crown's been fitted, we have some royal errands to run![wind whistling]",
    "Is that before or after the royal marshmallow-eating-contest gown?",
    "[laughs] It's okay, Rarity. I was just joking.",
    "What was that about?",
    "You're right. I'll just have to let everypony know that even with Celestia and Luna gone, we'll make sure things stay the same.",
    "I appreciate you taking such good care of my friends, but we're fine now.",
    "You sure this is just pre-coronation nerves?",
    "Except it was all a lie.",
    "You've been setting up challenges for us the whole time, haven't you? None of our successes were actually real.",
    "I... I need some time to think first.",
    "How?! Stopping Sombra by himself was hard enough! And that was with lord-of-chaos training wheels!",
    "My strengths? Right! Spike! Send a letter to Star Swirl! Tell him we need the Pillars to guard the border of Canterlot!",
    "[voiceover] If the villains are coming for a fight, we'll have one waiting for them! With Chrysalis on the loose, she'll go after Starlight! Warn Cadance and Shining Armor! They're our final line of defense if we fail!",
    "The ultimate battle for the fate of Equestria is coming!",
    "We've faced enemies of Equestria before. And we've always succeeded, no matter the odds. That wouldn't be possible without all of you.",
    "So I ask for your help again today in what is our biggest battle yet. All of Equestria is at stake, and I can't do this alone. But I'm not afraid. Because with friendship as our armor and teamwork as our power, nopony can ever bring us down![doors open]",
    "Cozy Glow?! You're\u2014!",
    "Aah! [groans]",
    ",",
    "Wait! What are you...?[zap!][reverberating gong][magic humming]",
    "NO!",
    "Keep telling yourself that! Now![whoosh!]",
    "You can attack us and we may fall. But Equestria will still stand, united in friendship. And we won't stop until we defeat you, no matter how many ponies you take down!",
    "Aah![shatter!]",
    "Huh?",
    "No! I can't leave you here!",
    "I'm afraid I am. Star Swirl sent me this enchanted flower, and it isn't doing well. If I figure out its magical properties, maybe we can save it.",
    "Oh, definitely. You could take the wrong train or miss your stop...",
    "I know it's hard, but sometimes you just can't do what you want.",
    "Sure, grown-ups can do a lot of things that foals can't. But there's plenty we can't do either. Like right now, I can't find a single reference to this flower!",
    "I wonder if there's anything in Shadetail Evergreen's ''Tome of Flora and Fauna''?",
    "I think there's a copy in the library filed under \"Discontinued But Still Potentially Useful Ancient Texts\". Unless I put it under \"Hokum With a Slight Chance of Practical Applications\".",
    "Well, once we read Shadetail Evergreen's warning that the flower grants wishes, it wasn't a stretch to think they wished themselves to the fair. It's all they were talking about.",
    "Yeah. Or that.",
    "You all go look for Spur. Fluttershy and I will do our best to keep everypony here safe.[teleportation zap][ewe bleats]",
    "They sure aren't, but young foals pretending to be grown-ups are even less so.",
    "There's only one petal left. But I think the three of you know what to wish for. And I'm pretty sure Star Swirl won't mind.",
    "I'm glad you learned something. That's what growing up is. Which is why you probably shouldn't skip any of it.",
    "A prank isn't very good if you're the only pony laughing.",
    "I know you can. I guess the trick is making sure that your idea of funny matches the pony you're pranking.",
    "That way\u2014[prolonged fart noise]",
    "Not really.",
    "I'm not sure she understood what we meant.",
    "Pinkie! We need your help.",

    "I think we all know how bad Rarity's been feeling, but I never thought she'd cancel her shoot with Photo Finish.",

    "How'd you end up using remover potion on your head, anyway?",
    "Huh. That's not ''that'' many.",
    "Princess Celestia obviously thinks I can or she would never have assigned them to me. I'm not planning on letting her down.",

    "No, but he might have figured it out on his own.",
    "I know. I'm just afraid of how he'll take it. I know what pride he takes in a job well done.",

    "Yeah, about that. I\u2013",

    "You here?",
    "No more hiding out. You're coming with me. Now.",
    "Honestly, Spike, I don't see why you're being so hard on yourself.",
    "Are you kidding? I've ''totally'' let ponies down. That's not the point. The torch got lit, the aerial relay teams got their medals \u2013 no harm, no foul.",
    "Wait a second. I think I get it. You keep saying you let everypony down, but we all keep saying you didn't. You know who's disappointed in you, Spike? You. And only you can make it right with you again. What would that take, Spike?",
    "Come on, Spike. You saved the Crystal Empire twice! I think you can light some fireworks.",
    "I'm sorry, Rainbow Dash. I just keep thinking about how much fun you're gonna have at the Daring Do convention. I wish Princess Celestia didn't need my help with the friendship summit in Griffonstone.",
    "[sighs]",
    "I can't believe you two are going on a friendship quest! This is amazing!",
    "Exactly! This is the first time the map has teamed up the same ponies for a second quest!",
    "I hope so, 'cause it looks like this one might be a little tricky. You're going to the Peaks of Peril.",
    "Only what Rockhoof told me. Back in his day, nopony knew much about the Peaks of Peril except for the legend on this ancient shield. It says a group called the Kirin used to live there, known for their kindness and truth-speaking.",
    "Unfortunately, other creatures also lived there. The Nirik, fearsome beasts of pure fire.",
    "Sorry, Fluttershy. Flanks don't lie.[shimmering]",
    "Pinkie Pie, you're more nervous than Rainbow Dash.",
    "Well, if you're so worried, then why don't ''you'' send her a letter first?",
    "Pinkie Pie, I'm sure Rainbow Dash still remembers our faces and who we are. But I think sending her a care package is a great idea.",
    "I'll go!",
    "Hold on!",
    "I'm sorry, Rainbow Dash. I know how much this meant to you.",
    "If somepony had told me when I was a blank flank that one day I'd give a speech to a class at Celestia's School of Magic, I wouldn't have believed it, but...[cards shuffling]",
    "I hope that I have been up to the task, because I can tell that all of you are and that the future of Equestrian magic is in good hooves.",
    "Eh, I don't know, Spike. I'd like to be able to get through the whole speech without looking at the cards.",
    "Oh, I'm not nervous, Spike, but I do have to set a good example, especially for magic students. That's why this speech has to be...",
    "Exactly. Let's go through it one more time. [clears throat] When Princess Celestia asked me to speak to you today, I was honored to have the opportunity to talk about my favorite subject magic.{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}",
    "Obviously, the long term effects of...",
    "...the simultaneous acquisition of cutie marks has yet to be determined, but... [sips water] Ahem. Next slide, please.",
    "I can speak from my own experience that the power of Cutie Mark Magic is very real, and in the instance of my friends and I, it can be traced to a single event! Without Rainbow Dash's race to defend Fluttershy's honor, this rainboom wouldn't have happened. Fluttershy might never have discovered her love of animals. Applejack might never have realized that she belonged on her farm. And Pinkie Pie might never have decided to leave hers. It might be hard to imagine Rarity without her sense of fabulousness. But it's even harder to fathom what ''my'' life would be like. Without this rainboom, I might not have gotten into magic school. Celestia wouldn't have taken me on as her pupil or sent me to Ponyville to meet my friends. And the most powerful thing about Cutie Mark Magic that I found is the connection I share with them.[beat]",
    "But, um...[cards shuffling]",
    "The real question about... Cutie Mark Magic is... who it seems to affect.",
    "I was sure I saw her, Spike. But when I looked again, she was gone! I'm just worried what she could be up to.",
    "Forcing everypony in her village to have the same cutie mark wasn't right. We had to do something!",
    "Honestly, Spike. I'm not really sure what I saw. But as long as I have my friends, I know everything will be all right.",
    "Maybe I was just more stressed about that speech than I thought.",
    "Well, when you say it like that, it does sound kinda silly.",
    "What are you doing, Starlight?",
    "I don't know, Spike, but I think we better find out!",
    "Spike, no! Don't touch that![magic zaps][clocks ticking]",
    "and",
    "and",
    "and",
    "I don't know, Spike, but it looked like she could fly with just magic! Keep your eyes open. We don't know what she has planned.[whoosh]",
    "Did Rainbow Dash look really young to you? And I didn't see a cutie mark. You don't think...",
    "Spike, only Star Swirl the Bearded could do something like that, and even his spell just went back a week! How could Starlight do more than the greatest wizard in Equestria?[paper rustling]",
    "Star Swirl's spell! Oh, no!",
    "Go where?",
    "What did you do?!",
    "and",
    "Ugh... I don't know what Starlight's up to yet, but we'd better figure it out before it's too late.",
    "[gasps]",
    "The map pulled us back, but whatever Starlight did in the past changed things here!",
    "More like ''when''.",
    "Starlight altered Star Swirl's spell, then somehow used it on the map to travel into the past and change something! Once she did, the map pulled us back to the present!",
    "Not exactly. Everything's different. Look. The map doesn't even make sense anymore! The Crystal Empire takes up half of Equestria!",
    "Right! This is too big to handle on our own.",
    "We need to find our friends and get help![crow cawing]",
    "I know, Spike, but this is Ponyville. How bad could things be?",
    "I don't understand.",
    "I don't think she's here, Spike. I'm not sure anything we know is the same. But I know one place that could never change![sign squeaking][machines grinding][squeaking][machines grinding and hissing][rumbling]",
    "Applejack?!",
    "It's so good to see you! We couldn't find Pinkie or Rarity or Fluttershy or Rainbow Dash, but I just knew you'd still be here!",
    "You... don't know who I am?",
    "The cause?",
    "and",
    "I know this is hard to believe, but you and I and those other ponies I mentioned are friends!",
    "I'm telling you the truth! And if you come with me, I'll prove it.",
    "Another pony named Starlight Glimmer used this map to travel through time and change things in the past. For some reason, the map's here but everything else is different!",
    "Well, for one thing, where we came from, there's no war with King Sombra. Maybe you could tell us how the war started, then we can figure out when everything changed!",
    "I just can't believe it! We stopped King Sombra! You and me and all of our friends!",
    "Right.",
    "Thank you. We're going to set things right.",
    "''I don't know!'' The only thing we know for sure is that Starlight stopped the rainboom.",
    "[gasps] Spike, that's it! The map is connected to the Tree of Harmony! It must sense that something isn't right! That's why it's still here! I'll just use Starlight's version of the spell and go back a little earlier and stop her before she even knows we're there![paper rustling][magic zaps][magic zaps]",
    "All we have to do now is find Starlight and\u2014[magic zap]",
    "Oops!",
    "No problem, Spike. At least now we know exactly what we have to do![teleportation zaps]",
    "Okay, keep your eyes peeled.",
    "We have to stop Starlight as soon as Rainbow Dash and those bullies race by!",
    "So be ready.",

    "What's going on here?",
    "Well, ''don't''!",
    "I mean... you were?",
    "No, of course not...",
    "No, it wouldn't! I mean, it'd be nice not to be teased, of course, but that's not the same thing!",
    "I know you only convinced those bullies to not tease Fluttershy to stop the rainboom!",
    "This isn't over yet!",
    "Hi!",
    "You think you can stop for a minute?",
    "I hear you're pretty fast!",
    "Okay, so, um, hey, you want to race?",
    "Come on, I thought you were fast![sproing]",
    "Okay, listen. You don't have to race me. I just need you to fly fast enough for a sonic rainboom!",
    "But it's not! I know it's not! I've seen you do it! In the future!",
    "No! Wait!",

    "Pinkie, how could you possibly know?",
    "But it makes no sense!",
    "Well, first, if you were tied to the train tracks, how are you now here?",
    "And second, the cake hasn't been sliced. It's been bitten. Just look at the teeth marks!",
    "Pinkie! There is no laser beam security system! And Joe is not sleek, stealthy Con Mane! He's big, gruff, and messy!",
    "''May'' be?",
    "Pinkie... that moose is a mousse!",
    "So you're saying that the culprit is...",
    "Pinkie, stop! This is ridiculous! Look at her!",
    "Thank you!",
    "Well, you have to stop the wild accusations and get to the truth. Everypony go back to your cars while we do a little investigating. Okay, Pinkie, in order to ''really'' solve this mystery, we're going to have to find clues. Now you were here at the scene of the crime all night.",
    "No! But maybe you ''saw'' something that will help us.",
    "Good... Let's retrace your steps.",
    "Hm... A-ha! Our first clue. I think I know who did it, Pinkie.",
    "Yes, but I need more evidence to confirm. Tell me what happened next.",
    "The conductor, huh? [gasp] But that doesn't make any sense. What happened next, Pinkie?",
    "Yes?",
    "Interesting. Anything else?",
    "Oh my, what is that?",
    "What next Pinkie?",
    "And when you woke up, half the cake was gone?",
    "By Jove, I think I've got it. Call everypony back. We have a cake culprit to catch.",
    "I bet you're wondering why you're all here again.",
    "We have discovered the true culprit of this cake carnage.",
    "Well, you see, when committing a crime, it's crucial that one never leaves behind clues, especially an obvious clue like... ''this''.[gasp]",
    "Pinkie, Gustave doesn't have blue feathers.",
    "No, Pinkie. Remember how when you chased the suspect to the caboose, they suddenly disappeared? That's because they ''flew away''. But the thief ''did'' leave a little something behind, didn't you, Rainbow Dash?",
    "Case not solved, because when we went to the engine, I saw the conductor's hat. And inside the hat was... ''this''.",
    "Pinkie, remember? You chased a pony to the engine, where you thought you saw the conductor shoveling coal, but that wasn't the conductor at all. It was... Fluttershy!",
    "Pinkie! But then another clue confounded my suspicions. You were guarding the cake when the curtains mysteriously closed. But that's no mystery, that's magic. But when the thief tried to make their great escape, they left a little addition to the portrait. Has anypony else noticed that Rarity is wearing her hair rather differently today?",
    "''Really?''",
    "But it isn't. We figured out who ate the Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness, but we still don't know who devoured the other bakers' goods.",
    "Well... Yes, I do. Do you?",
    "Well, Pinkie. Did you find the devourer of the desserts?",
    "What do you say, bakers?",
    "Well, everypony, we finally have the mystery solved.",
    "Care for a bite?",
    "As princess, I've been chosen to spread the magic of friendship across Equestria. So why would the Tree of Harmony want us to sit in a castle in Ponyville?[rumbling]",
    "Seems like the map wants us to find out.",
    "An entire village with the same cutie mark?",
    "It's a trap!",
    "[groaning]",
    "Ugh, we've gotta find a way out of here! I can't take much more of that voice!",
    "Something odd about that staff. I haven't studied Eastern unicorns as much as I should have, but I'm pretty sure Meadowbrook only had ''eight'' magical items, not nine. And I don't remember any of them being a staff.",
    "I've got it!",
    "I know how we can get out!",
    "But there is a third way.",
    "We don't actually have to escape. They'll just let us out when they think we've accepted their philosophy!",
    "There's one of us they might believe.[beat]",
    "You've gotta find a way to get our cutie marks back.",
    "Fluttershy? How could you?!",
    "We have to stay as positive as we can. If Party Favor sees how much we really do like each other, even though we're all different, maybe we can use him to spread our message to the rest of the village.[loudspeaker crackles]",
    "I-I think so. But I just want to be sure. If I agree to leave my cutie mark in the vault, I'll really be happier?",
    "And you wouldn't let me just live here in the village with my old cutie mark?",
    "Everypony has unique talents and gifts, and when we share them with each other, that's how rea\u2014",
    "If we hadn't come here to help them, they'd still be living under her rules! Now it's their turn to help us!",
    "I studied magic for years too! But what I didn't know then was that studying could only take me so far. Each of my friends has taught me something different about myself! It was their unique gifts and passions and personalities that helped bring out the magic inside of me! I never would have learned that I represent the element of magic without these five! And I certainly wouldn't be here to stop you now!",
    "We just have to hope that when she's had a chance to think it over, she realizes that you all ''have'' taught her something.",
    "Does that mean you'll stay in the village?",
    "I have a feeling it means our work here is done.",
    "But the map didn't send ''me''. It sent ''us''. You're a part of me, all of you. And there's no doubt you're a part of my mission to spread friendship too.",

    "A 'Crystal Faire'. According to this book, it was established by their first queen and became their most important tradition. The Faire was held every year to \"renew the spirit of love and unity in the empire so they could protect it from harm\". My friends and I could put it together.

    "I've even devised a better system for organizing them. It decreases the amount of time it takes to find a book you're looking for by nearly three quarters of a second!",

    "If our friends could enjoy three full days with Discord that much, it must have something to do with the specific things they did together! If we could find out what those things were, it could be a real breakthrough in the science of friendship!",
    "I know so! You thought our book-sort-cation was fun? This is gonna be even better!",
    "Thank you for coming. I wouldn't have asked you here if it wasn't important.",

    "Alright, so you sat down at the table, and then what happened?",
    "Yes?",
    "...Really?",
    "Are you sure there's not something you've missed? Some other detail about your lunch together that you're forgetting?",
    "But it is really important that I figure this out. It's for the good of all Equestria![ticker tape machine whirring]",
    "What?",
    "Me?",
    "I'm not buying it. Not for a second. There is definitely something else going on here, Spike!",
    "Even if I'm not able to laugh at what happened, I should be able to figure out why ''they'' find it funny. Why ''they'' think they had this amazing and hilarious time together. But I can't figure it out! It doesn't make sense!",
    "Our friends ''think'' something great happened to them while I was away, but ''no''. It was something awful! If we don't break the spell they're under, who knows what terrible things could happen?!",
    "Come on, Spike! There's no time to lose!",
    "Zecora, what do you think? Can you undo Discord's magic?[powder falling, cauldron bubbling]",
    "They're having ''fun'' with Discord, that's why!",
    "Trust me, they would never laugh like that unless something magical was involved. It's not that funny. ''I'' know funny.",
    "Hey, gang!",
    "I am excited! We're gonna have fun today!",
    "Just one tiny, minuscule, microscopic thing before fun times. I need everypony to sip this potion to break Discord's spell on you!",
    "Don't be embarrassed. So what if Discord cast a spell on you so you ''thought'' you had a great time, and now you have all these inside jokes that you seem to be ''constantly'' laughing at? Don't worry! You didn't have your defenses up. I get it.[liquid pouring]",
    "Uh-huh. Or you reenacted what you thought was fun but really wasn't because you were under a spell that made you think what happened was fun!",
    "Be honest. The only reason you won't drink the potion is because, deep down in your hearts, you know there's a chance that Discord has you under his power!",
    "\"The gang\"?",
    "Ugh. But it's still not funny!",
    "But ''I'' wasn't there! ''I'' wasn't included! Maybe it's my own fault for staying in and having a book-sort-cation when I could have been making jokes and memories and having a great time with my friends! But I didn't do that, did I?! You all did! You were all there, but\u2014! [sighs] I ''wasn't'' there. I missed out. And seeing you having all these jokes I wasn't a part of and couldn't understand made me...",
    "No. The Princess of Friendship can't get jealous.",
    "You didn't do anything wrong. You're allowed to share things that don't include me.",
    "They wanted me to be there? And you convinced them to not invite me?",
    "Come on, you'd have to be a complete crazy pony to think he'd do something like that! What are you gonna say next, Pinkie? That we all have to drink some weird potion to break the spell?",

    "For-ev-er...",
    "Deal! Wait. Are you sure this counts? Mom and Dad aren't giving us any stars.",
    "So that's what we're up against.",
    "It's ''more'' than that! Okay, it's exactly that. And to protect Celestia's castle!",
    "We play to our strengths and defeat all of the security measures. That way, if one of us fails, the others will still have a shot at getting the crown. Pinkie, you'll distract the guards with a surprise party.",
    "Applejack, you'll buck your way into the sealed tunnels. Rainbow Dash, if anypony can outfly those wind turbines, it's you. Rarity, you'll sew us guard costumes so we can sneak past security. Then Fluttershy will disable the throne room alarm by charming the geese.",
    "What?! Pinkie party, Rarity costumes... \"Signed, the future Sibling Supreme\"?! Oh, come on! [grumbles]",
    "So you're saying I should give up?",
    "I didn't know you had an alter ego. And why would she be giving a farewell performance?",
    "Mm-mm. I guess I'm the only one left that still needs a plan.",

    "Nope. Just looking at the flowers. [sniffs, sighs]",
    "[sniffs] Ooh! Maybe Rarity's plan ''will'' work!",
    "Where's Spike and Fluttershy? Did they make it into the castle?",
    "Let's hope Rarity and Rainbow Dash had better luck.",

Can I help you? [sighs]",
    "I may be the princess on duty, but I don't think that means I have to sit up there all alone doing nothing.

    "Hey!",
    "Uh, just a moment, please! Pinkie, I appreciate your help and all, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this. Nopony should trade for my books just because I'm a princess. I'm not better than anypony else!",
    "Oh, yes, they are.",
    "None of those ponies had anything valuable enough to trade for my books. Not because these books belong to a princess, but because they helped make me who I am. Just like you said. This was the one I was so absorbed in the day Spike decided he owed Applejack a life debt. And this one reminds me of the day I got it \u2013 which was the day I met you. I may not ever need to read these again, but that doesn't mean they don't have value. I realize that now, thanks to you, Pinkie.",

    "Sorry, Spike. It's just Pinkie Pie, Rarity, and Applejack are getting back from their Seaward Shoals boat trip, and I can't wait to hear all about it! It's such a shame Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy had to miss it for their Cloudsdale flight school reunion. Maybe the rest of us not going was for the best anyway. I know the three of them were really looking forward to getting out of their element.",
    "I think they all just wanted to try something new.",
    "My only worry is that they'll be so excited, they'll talk over each other, and I'll miss some of the details! Just to be safe, I may need you to take notes.[train chuffing]",
    "So how was the trip?",
    "I don't know what happened on that boat trip. But once Rarity, Applejack, and Pinkie Pie have some tea and talk it out, I'm sure everypony will feel better.[splash]",
    "Come on in, everypony! Gummy, Opalescence, and Winona? This is a surprise!",
    "[reading] \"Sorry, darling, but I must decline the invitation to your soiree. While I'm sure it will be positively resplendent, there are certain ponies I'd rather not associate with at the moment. Rarity.\"",
    "[reading] \"Sorry I can't make it, but I'm still a mite upset about everything that happened on the boat. Applejack.\" \"Sorry I can't make the tea party today, but there's a small problem with the guest list. Plus, I'm right in the middle of a very important cupcake. Pinkie.\" Come on, Spike! Since our friends won't come here and tell us what happened, we'll just have to go to them!",
    "I don't know, Rarity. Maybe you could\u2014",
    "About that. Spike and I were wondering what happened out there.",
    "Hmm... That doesn't sound like Applejack.",
    "So Applejack got some sort of sea madness and caused the boat to capsize?",
    "Rarity, I don't suppose there's any chance you might be... uh, exaggerating things? Just a little?",
    "We thought there was a chance she might have... [clears throat] embellished the story just a tad. So we wanted to hear about what happened from you! Did Applejack really capsize the boat?",
    "I knew it!",
    "and",
    "Wait, wait, wait. That doesn't sound like Rarity.",
    "That seems... odd. I mean, we trust you, of course. But it's all so... extraordinary?",
    "Good idea. She'll straighten this out.",
    "Do you want to say it, or should I?",
    "Wait, so it was Rarity ''and'' Pinkie's fault?",
    "Neither do I, Spike. Neither do I.",
    "There's gotta be some way to fix this. If Applejack, Pinkie Pie, and Rarity keep not talking to each other, they could forget what good friends they really are!",
    "Their stories were different, but they also had a lot in common.",
    "Not quite.[chalk drawing]",
    "A-ha! Not only do I think I know how the boat sank, I have a pretty good idea how to get Rarity, Applejack and Pinkie Pie back together!",
    "Sorry, but I just didn't know how else to get the three of you here together, and there really is a friendship emergency! Yours!",
    "I know you each have a different perspective on how the boat capsized and blame each other, but if you come on the boat with me I'll show you what ''really'' happened.",
    "Don't worry, Spike. I've got it all under control. [to the others] While all of your stories seem very different, they all had something in common \u2013 cucumber sandwiches.[clunk]",
    "You also mentioned the bubbling water.[bubbling]",
    "''And'' the swell. Cucumber just happens to be the favorite food of the tri-horned bunyip, and bubbles followed by a swell is what happens when they swim up to the shallows from deep water.",

    "A tri-horned bunyip! Who's very sorry he accidentally knocked over your boat. Right?[bunyip noises]",
    "Nope!",
    "I think I can explain that too. Each of you spent so much time trying to come up with the perfect way to get the others out of their element, that you didn't notice your friends were doing the same thing!",
    "I guess this just teaches us that even long time friends need to work at communication.",
    "One thing's for sure, Spike. There's nothing like a luxurious adventure boat party to get you out of your element.",

Three of our worst villains have taken over, powered up by ancient magic. Everypony in Equestria is so scared and divided that the windigos are circling. And it's up to us to fix it all.",
    "The same thing we do every time, Pinkie. Try to save the world!",
    "That bell has Discord, Celestia, and Luna's magic inside. If they use it against us\u2014",
    "You can't beat us if we never give up! As long as I have my friends by my side, I'll put my faith in friendship\u2014",
    "We need to get that bell and get Discord and the princesses their magic back. Rainbow Dash, Pinkie, you're with me.",
    "No. We're the distraction. ''They're'' gonna get the bell.[boom!]",
    "[yells]",
    "Please! Don't hurt him!",
    "It's not me![marching sounds][whooshing][transformation zaps]",
    "I don't understand. How are you all here?",
    "ENOUGH! Because of you, I almost lost my way! But everycreature here has reminded me of the true power of friendship! There will always be darkness in the world, but there will also always be those who find the light! The Pillars knew this! That's why they created the Elements of Harmony! The Elements showed me and my friends how strong our friendship could be! Together we worked to bring harmony to Equestria! But there will always be more to do! Which is why we teach others about the Magic of Friendship! Others who will continue our mission after we are gone! Now I truly understand! The Elements were just symbols! The real magic has always been right here! And the more who understand how powerful friendship is, the stronger we will all be! Together![magic surging][boom!]",
    "Pinkie! You took Discord's magic from the bell?! How do you feel?",
    "You know what? I think I am.",
    "Actually, as ruler of Equestria, I'd like to postpone the coronation for a while. At least until the castle's rebuilt. Besides, there's something we need to do first.",
    "I know. But there's gonna be plenty of time for all the challenges and struggles and adventures to come. For now, I just want to spend a quiet moment with the six best friends I've ever had.",
    "All I know is whatever comes next is going to be perfect.",
    "With you guys by my side, how could it not?",
    "Spike, you really need to go to sleep!",
    "\"The Mane-iac\"?",
    "Hum Drum?",
    "Believe me, Spike. If anypony understands what it's like to get caught up in a really good book, it's me. But if we're going to make any progress fixing up Luna and Celestia's old castle tomorrow, we all have to do our part. We don't want to be too tired to lend a hoof... or claw.",
    "Two more minutes.",
    "Looking good, everypony! Let's keep this magical makeover moving!",
    "I think she's right. It looks like we've got it, Spike. Looking great, everypony! Why don't you find a quiet spot and finish reading your comic? Aren't you right at the part where Hum Drum was about to stop the villain?",
    "Rarity, lemme give you a hoof with that!",
    "That's okay, Spike.",
    "Spike! What are you\u2014",
    "Spike! [straining noises]",
    "We wouldn't have made it without you, Spike. And I hope you realize that just because we don't always need your help, it doesn't mean that we don't think you're helpful.",
    "But I do have one question. Where exactly did you get that comic book?",
    "[panting, yelping]",
    "I'm just doing a final check, Spike.",
    "Ah-ha! See? An issue of ''Power Ponies''. Now, aren't you glad we triple-checked?",
    "No-no-no! You love ''Power Ponies''. We're taking it.",
    "Just because things change doesn't mean you leave everything you love behind! [sighs]",
    "No. I know it took some time, but I've never been more ready for anything in my life. Just because I'm ready to sit on the throne in Canterlot, doesn't mean I'm ready to leave Ponyville. When we were all fighting to save Equestria from Tirek, Chrysalis, and Cozy Glow, I was too busy to think about it. But now it's all happening at once.",
    "The coronation. Moving. Leaving our friends.",
    "Of course we will, but it won't be the same. They all have lives here. We're moving away and they're not, and I can't help but feel like we're leaving them behind. What if we all just drift apart?",
    "You're right, Spike. Thanks. Sometimes talking to a good friend is all it takes.[crates closing][stamping]",
    "So, you're not worried about how things might change with me living in Canterlot?",
    "I guess so.",
    "But what about after the coronation? Don't you think things are gonna be different?",
    "No. Of course not.[birds chirping][doves cooing]",
    "[nervous laugh] Yeah. Me, neither.",
    "[sighs]",
    "I don't think the Power Ponies care, Spike. Just like all of our friends.",
    "Well, I'll be living in Canterlot alone. Might as well take the train alone, too. Bye, I guess.",
    "That's the problem! You're all so worried about making my coronation perfect, but I'm leaving Ponyville and none of you even care!",
    "I tried to talk to you all about how I was feeling, but you seemed more worried about what you had to do for the coronation.",
    "Before I moved to Ponyville, I didn't really know what friendship was. You've all taught me so much. I can't believe it all might be ending. But when I imagine the future, all I can think about is that we won't be together! I'm literally moving away from you, and it's terrifying!",
    "I know it's weird, but knowing you're all are as upset as I am actually makes me less worried.",
    "Oh, no! We missed it! But maybe...[teleportation zap]",
    "Okay. We're on the train. Everything should be fine, right?[beat]",
    "Well, it could always be worse.[brakes screech][sheep baaing][doors open]",
    "[panting]",
    "My friends and I had a few hiccups on the way. But everything's fine now.[sheep baaing]",
    "[whimpering]",
    "[yelps][thud]",
    "Sorry.[magic surges][crowd ooh's]",
    "Aah![crowd gasps]",
    "[whimpers]",
    "[groans]",
    "That was something.",
    "Awww.",
    "I love it. Thank you so much. But I don't want to only look back. Obviously the coronation wasn't perfect, but that doesn't matter. It's our relationships that really count, and we have to maintain them.",
    "I am. I suggest we meet once a moon. In fact, my first royal decree as ruler of Equestria is to establish this Council of Friendship!",
    "You're leaving?",
    "Thank you. For everything. Mmmm! [chuckling]",
    "[clears throat] Good morning, class. Today, we're going to learn about friendship through the ages. Spike, slide one, please.[slide projector turns on]",
    "Back in the days of Chancellor Puddinghead... Uh, Spike?",
    "Yes, Spike. As I was saying... Huh? What are you three doing here?",
    "But why?",
    "I see. Why don't you three come with me? Spike, you're in charge.",
    "No, thanks, Starlight. I've got this.",
    "[to Cutie Mark Crusaders] I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but... you can't be my students.",
    "Yes, but we teach ''friendship'' lessons here. You already know all about helping ponies in need and being there for each other.",
    "You need Cheerilee's classes, not mine. Hurry up. You don't want late marks on your permanent record.[door opens]",
    "Spike?! What did you do?",
    "Ahem. I'd like to see you three in my office!",
    "I can't believe you'd do something like this!",
    "You ''are'' Cozy Glow's tutors, aren't you?",
    "That's what she told me. So you've been setting her up to ''fail''?{||",
    "I know you're upset that I won't let you come to my school, but to teach Cozy all the wrong things out of spite... That's just cruel!",
    "Then how do you explain these friendship test answers? [reading] \"What are the six Elements of Harmony?\" Five turtlenecks and a cheese grater? \"Who is the Princess of Friendship?\" Your mom?",
    "Me neither. I never thought you three would pull such a mean prank. I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to stay away from my school. ''And'' my students.[door closes]",
    "I know that. Now. Which is why I wanted to talk to you.",
    "Thank you, Cozy Glow. Honesty is one of the pillars of friendship. [to Cutie Mark Crusaders] But ''you'' already know that. Which is why I'd like to give you these.[thud]",
    "And if you're interested, I think Starlight has a place for you at my school after all.",
    "And that's why this school needs ''you'' as our guidance counselor.",
    "A friendship problem?",
    "[simultaneously] Okay!",
    "Wow, Fluttershy! I've never heard you speak with such conviction.",
    "So what are you gonna do now?",
    "Ooh, a library cave?",
    "I thought you said no more experts.",
    "Big Daddy McColt! [to the others] We met each other back when the map called me and Fluttershy to the Smokey Mountains!",
    "You look nervous. There's no reason to be nervous. Nothing to worry about. Everything's gonna be fine!",
    "Ohhhh...",
    "[inhales] [exhales] You're right. Remember, Equestria and Yakyakistan haven't opened their borders for hundreds of moons. In fact, Yakyakistan is so far north of the Crystal Mountains, nopony's even been there! Imagine the look on Princess Celestia's face when she finds out we made friends with a yak prince! [nervous laugh] I'm calm! I'm calm...",
    "Prince Rutherford, your Majesty. On behalf of all of us, I welcome you to Equestria.",
    "You must be hungry after a long journey.[table scraping]",
    "We've prepared a banquet of traditional yak foods.",
    "[gulp]",
    "All we have to do is show them how great it can be to have friends before Princess Celestia arrives for the friendship party tonight. Now, who read the seven-volume cross-indexed history of Yakyakistan I recommended?",
    "Pinkie Pie, can you show them around town? I know you have to plan the friendship party too, but it would really help make them feel welcome.",
    "Remember, we want to make sure Equestria feels like home. That means doing everything we can to make this place feel like Yakyakistan.",
    "Good. Let's get out there and make some new friends!",
    "Pinkie Pie, tonight's Yakyakistan theme party is more important than ever! You'll make them forget all about this afternoon, right? Because if it's ''not'' perfect, they're gonna smash everything! And I'm not sure how much more smashing this visit can take!",
    "Pinkie Pie, I don't know what we'd do without you\u2014",
    "And this is Sugarcube Corner. They're working hard to make your traditional Yakyakistan cake.",
    "Do you mind, um, waiting here for one moment?[teleporting zap]",
    "How's tonight's party coming? I'm doing what I can, but it's really up to you at this point! ...Pinkie? Where are you?!",
    "[teeth chattering] Did you find her?",
    "But the party! It's all we have left! What are we gonna do?![whack]",
    "[reading] \"Don't worry. I'll be back in time for the party. Love, Pinkie Pie.\" If Pinkie Pie says she'll be back in time for the party, she'll be back. We have to trust her. Right? [nervous laugh] No reason to ''freak out!''",
    "[inhales] [exhales] You're right. Let's just focus on keeping the yaks happy 'til she's back.",
    "''The cake!''",
    "We've never needed a party so badly.",
    "Phew!",
    "Spike!",
    "No! Just a little longer!",
    "and",
    "No Pinkie Pie? What's this?!",
    "The yaks are going home! This is awful! I wanted to surprise Princess Celestia. Now the only surprise is that I may have just started a war.[wind blowing]",
    "How could she be so late to the party? This isn't like her.",
    "I know you're right, but... I wish she was here. I put too much pressure on her. I let everypony down. And Princess Celestia will be here any minute and see that I haven't made new friends. I've made new enemies. [sighs][gears clicking]",
    "Ugh. Is everypony alright?",
    "That's right!",
    "No, I'm not! They're just so... [shudders] cheesy.",
    "I had no idea she worked so hard on her parties.",
    "Let's not get carried away.",
    "You're back!",
    "Pinkie Pie, you're not a failure.",
    "It's too late. The yaks left on the last train.",
    "Wow, Pinkie. This came together quick, even for you.",
    "[sighs]",
    "Heh. Just doing my best to spread friendship.",
    "[giggling] That's what happens when you're summoned by the Map.",
    "[giggling]",
    "Actually, where you're going isn't even ''in'' Equestria.",
    "Mount Aris, the home of the Hippogriffs! And that's where you're headed!",
    "I know that. But I'm not so sure the ponies who care about you want you going off so far on your own. Besides, there's some school business I need to take care of on Mount Aris. This permission slip is for Silverstream. It's very important that her mother and father sign it, or else no field trips.",
    "Okay, yes, I have been wanting to visit Mount Aris ever since the Hippogriffs moved back. But it's purely research. Silverstream's brother is gonna meet us there and take us to their houses.",
    "I guess so. The social structure of the Hippogriffs and seaponies is a bit of a mystery.",
    "Wait, what? She told you ''she'' defeated him? By herself?",
    "[giggling][train whistle blows]",
    "I don't know. But Hippogriffs don't have cutie marks. So it might not have anything to do with that at all.",
    "The Map doesn't really work like that. But I'm sure you and whoever needs help will find each other.[water splashing]",
    "But others got used to living under the water and stayed in Seaquestria.",
    "Well, I'm pretty eager to see the Hippogriff village. You know, to... get this form signed. And... research! So...",
    "Whoa! This looks amazing! Last time I was here, it was a ghost town!",
    "and",
    "Absolutely! ''And'' to have you sign a form for Silverstream.",
    "Eh. Research. See you later! And good luck! I know you'll find your mission!",
    "Hey, everypony! This festival is fantastic! Look what I won at the ring toss booth! Ahem. But of course, I'm really here on business. Sky Beak's already signed the form. Now I just need your mom's signature. Is she around?",
    "''That's'' what Silverstream meant by \"houses\"!",
    "Well, she is one of our most hardworking students. In fact, I brought this form for you to sign so that\u2014",
    "That sounds adorable! I'd love to! And you know, to find out about aquatic pony early development and, uh...",
    "Why not? Could be another trophy in my future! Be back soon!",
    "Uh, what's going on? Where's Terramar?",
    "Well, of course not. Why would you think that?",
    "Whoever said that he ''had'' to choose?",
    "Hmmm... Maybe Terramar's making it harder than it has to be.",
    "Actually, we're right in the middle of\u2014",
    "Thank you, really. I've had a great time in both places today, but... [whispering, to Cutie Mark Crusaders] Wow. This must be how Terramar feels all the time.",
    "[laughing]",
    "Congratulations! Your first map mission is a success!",
    "Cup Cake and Carrot Cake must be so proud!",
    "And be careful around Pumpkin Cake.",
    "I have to finish this report for the Princess summarizing all my ''other'' reports to the Princess.",
    "Hi! I finished up the work I had to do, so I thought I'd stop by and see if you needed any help. Whoa!",
    "It's okay, Pinkie. I figured you would need some help. That's why I stopped by.",
    "Babies take a lot of work, and some ponies are just not cut out to handle the responsibility.",
    "I'm happy to help! It's no trouble\u2013[door slams]",
    "Uh... Are those real measurements? How do you keep track without a recipe?",
    "Seventy-third? That's specific.",
    "You sure are going to a lot of trouble for Rainbow Dash's pie.",
    "Isn't that for the pie?",
    "[chuckles]{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}",
    "Well, you have been lying to her. To all of us, actually.",
    "Let's go through this one more time.",
    "Yes, but why?",
    "As princess, I've been chosen to spread the magic of friendship across Equestria. So why would the Tree of Harmony want us to sit in a castle in Ponyville? It doesn't make any sense.[rumbling]",
    "I don't know. But it seems like the map wants us to find out. The Tree, the chest, this castle, and now the map. How can we ''not'' follow it?",
    "Looks like it's time for a road trip.",
    "That's it! That's the place on the map!",
    "Wait. We don't know why the map sent us here. We shouldn't just walk right in. It could be dangerous.",
    "Forget the smiles. Look at the cutie marks.",
    "An entire village with the same cutie mark? How can that be?",
    "What makes you say that?",
    "We're not entirely sure.",
    "If you don't mind, has there been any sort of... trouble here, lately?",
    "Yes, but \"Twilight\" is fine.",
    "It's kind of a long story. Let's just say we found it on a map.",
    "Is that why you all have those cutie marks?",
    "I'm sorry, I guess we're just a little confused by all of this.",
    "When we were sent to this village, we assumed it was to help in some way. But, well, it doesn't seem like you need any help.",
    "A cutie mark is a representation of a pony's unique talents and skills. How is it possible to\u2014",
    "Uh, no! We're good! [hushed] Fluttershy's right. If we're going to get to the bottom of why the map sent us here, we'll need the help of these ponies.",
    "[hushed] Maybe you're right. But we're here now, and it sure feels like something's wrong.",
    "Then I guess we'll take six muffins!",
    "[hushed] Come on, girls. We've got to stick together. It doesn't matter what happened before, we're here now.",
    "We ''are'' friends. A simple disagreement wouldn't change that.",
    "[hushed] Let's all sit here and eat these muffins and act normal. I think we're being watched.[scissors snipping]",
    "[hushed] No, not like that! I mean somepony here doesn't want us talking to Sugar Belle.",
    "Nice work, Pinkie.[thumps and honks]",
    "Hello? Sugar Belle?",
    "Why did you want us to come down here?",
    "How do you take somepony's cutie mark anyway?",
    "But nopony should keep you from your cutie mark. It represents such an essential part of who you are.",
    "Can we visit this cave?",
    "[hushed, over] This must be the reason we're here.",
    "[hushed] No, helping those ponies get their cutie marks back.",
    "[hushed] Then why did they want to meet us in secret? And why did they ask us not to tell Starlight who told us about the vault? Something's not right.",
    "I've never seen anything like it!",
    "Pinkie!",
    "It's a trap![magic zaps]",
    "[groaning]",
    "Give them back!",
    "Spike! I have horrible news!",
    "What? No! We only have twenty highlighters! And they're all orange! How will everycreature color-code their notes?!",
    "Still, twenty isn't enough for the new school year!",
    "Well, this is a surprise. Why are you all here so early? Did I send out the wrong back-to-school date?!",
    "[gasps]",
    "But the Tree couldn't have called you. It's gone! Sombra destroyed it!",
    "Those are gone, too.",
    "As long as you promise to stick together. The Castle of the Two Sisters isn't the safest place, as you may remember.",
    "Well, as long as you get permission from your kingdoms, I suppose it's all right.",
    "I felt a burst of magic all the way over at the school! Is everycreature okay?",
    "[gasps] Where did ''this'' come from?",
    "The Tree has always been good at surprises. When Star Swirl planted the Tree's seed, he didn't even know what it would grow into. I guess the Tree is still alive, changing and adapting to be whatever Equestria needs.",
    "Something tells me this is more than that. It seems the Elements of Harmony may still be with us in their own way.",
    "I'm not sure. If I had to guess, I'd say your friendship is more powerful than you know.",
    "[giggles] Why don't we all go in together?",
    "Okay, here goes.[magical chime]",
    "Sorry, Romeo. As attractive and enticing as you look, it's just for practice, and it's gotta go.",
    "[laughter]{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}",
    "True, for ponies whose talents are for things like cooking or singing or math. But what if a unicorn's special talent ''is'' magic?",

    "Really?",
    "Where is this unicorn?",
    "There's nothing wrong with being talented, is there?",
    "Spike! Shhh!",
    "You see the way they reacted to Trixie? I don't want anyone thinking ''I'm'' a show-off.[fanfare]",

    "Nothing.",
    "What do you mean? I'm nothing special.",
    "I'm not better than anyone.",
    "Who, me? I'm just your run-of-the-mill citizen of Ponyville. No powerful magic here. I, uh... I think I hear my laundry calling. Sorry, gotta go.",
    "Didn't you see how they hated Trixie's bragging, Spike? If I go out there and show off my magic, I run the risk of losing them as friends.",
    "No, Spike, it's exactly the same.",

    "So, you don't mind my magic tricks?",
    "You are?",
    "That's what I was doing when you came looking for me. I was so intrigued by Trixie's bragging that I was compelled to do a little reading up on them.",
    "That wasn't an ursa major. It was a baby, an ursa ''minor''.",
    "And it wasn't rampaging. It was just cranky because ''someone'' woke it up.",
    "You don't wanna know.",
    "Just let her go. Maybe someday she'll learn her lesson. Now, about you two.",
    "For starters, you can clean up this mess. And... What do you think, Spike? Should I give them number twenty five?",
    "I think you're right.",
    "''Dear Princess Celestia,''''I have learned a very valuable lesson about friendship I was so afraid of being thought of as a show-off that I was hiding a part of who I am. My friends helped me realize that it's okay to be proud of your talents, and there are times when it's appropriate to show them off... Especially when you're standing up for your friends.''",
    "Well, yeah, but it's nothing to brag about. So, uh, how did it go with Rarity?",

    "Whoa! Oof!",
    "Applejack, you know you don't have to call me that.",
    "If other ponies want to address me that way, I suppose it's fine, but... not my friends. It just doesn't feel right. [sigh] And neither does all this flying business. The Summer Sun Celebration is only two days away, and I'm ''never'' gonna be ready to perform my part.",

    "But I am. I just know it.",
    "So do I.",
    "[sighs] That would be nice, Spike, but what if something else came up while we were gone? What if we were delayed getting back and I wasn't able to finish everything on that list? What if we lost the list on the way to Ponyville and then couldn't remember which things we'd done and which things we hadn't done, and then spent so much time trying to figure out what we hadn't done and what we had done, and we ruined the entire Celebration by not doing the one really important thing that we were supposed to do?![thud]",

But all that changed when King Grover found the mysterious golden Idol of Boreas. Legend says the Idol of Boreas was made from the dust of golden sunsets, blown across the mountains by the north winds. Possessing the Idol of Boreas filled the griffons' hearts with pride.

    "No, no, if the map wanted me to go to the coolest kingdom in all of Equestria and tour the palace and see the actual idol that unites an entire species, which would be super amazing, I'm sure it would've said so. You two can handle whatever the issue is just fine. I'll stay here and do important princessy things. I guess.",
    "[voiceover] Upon arriving in Griffon Gorge, be sure to pause and cast your eyes northerly, up the Hyperborean Mountains, taking in the breathtaking beauty of Griffonstone. Once in Griffonstone proper, go immediately to the palace and introduce yourself to the king. \"Bygone Griffons of Greatness\" was written a long time ago, and it ends with the coronation of the fourteenth king of the griffons, King Guto. I have no idea who's in charge now. Tell the king you've been sent by the Princess of Friendship, and you're there to help with some sort of problem. If for some reason the king can't help, I'd try the Griffonstone library next. It's a little known secret that if you befriend a librarian, you can usually find out anything. Plus, as a bonus, there's a statue of King Grover outside! [giggles] Photo op! And don't forget to sample some famous griffon scones. They're supposed to be the ''best''.",

    "And there's nothing wrong with it. In fact, you should enjoy your indulgent hooficure.",
    "Exactly. I'm not ''only'' a princess, and you're not ''only'' an athlete. Think of all the non-sports things you're into.",

    "I don't know what we ''can'' do.",
    "Oh, no! Her wings evaporated into thin air!",
    "[gasp]",
    "I'm sure you can, but right now I think I need to relax in my own quiet way.",
    "Wow. I guess you don't realize how much tension you hold in your flank. Ooh. Oh, yeah. This is exactly what I needed. I love Rainbow Dash, but sometimes she can be a little much.[whooshing][screeching]",
    "Ooh! Ow! Uh... maybe not quite so hard. [sighs] That's better. Dash might be a hoofful sometimes, but she's the most loyal friend in Equestria.",
    "Even with Rainbow Dash's replacement, I don't think we're gonna qualify. No offense.",

    "We have had some pretty great times together.",
    "[grunts] Whoa!",
    "Whoa! Oof!",
    "Applejack, you know you don't have to call me that.",
    "If other ponies want to address me that way, I suppose it's fine, but... not my friends. It just doesn't feel right. [sigh] And neither does all this flying business. The Summer Sun Celebration is only two days away, and I'm ''never'' gonna be ready to perform my part.",

    "Is it a bird?",
    "Oh. I usually get letters by dragon.",

    "Trixie, put him down. Why are you doing this?",
    "Alright, Trixie. Let's duel!",
    "[grunts] Phew. [gasps][poik][parasprite burping]",
    "[exhales][snow melting]",
    "An age spell? But... how could you do an age spell? That's only for the highest level unicorns![wiping noise]",
    "[sighs] [grunts]",
    "[yelps][pop][thud]",
    "It's okay, guys. I'll figure something out. Just take care of each other. And keep an eye on Trixie. There's something strange about her.",
    "[grunts of exertion] Ugh! It's impossible! How could Trixie know such advanced magic? Without Spike, I can't get a message to the Princess in Saddle Arabia. So who else do I know who understands strange and powerful magic?[tribal music]",
    "I don't know what to do, Zecora. I feel like I've abandoned my friends. But I can't take her on horn-to-horn.",
    "''You'll'' train me in magic? But she was doing ''age'' spells, ''weather'' spells, you name it!",
    "You really think I can beat her?",
    "Okay, when do we start?",
    "[grunts]",
    "[yelps][splash]",
    "I'm sorry, Zecora. I'm trying my best, but... I can't stop thinking about Trixie. There was something different about her. It's like she's gone from high and mighty to mean and nasty.",
    "I can't believe I didn't recognize the Alicorn Amulet!",
    "But how am I supposed to beat that amulet? My magic's not good enough!",
    "Nix your magic, use the six... Nix your magic, use the six! Use the six! That's it! Zecora, you're a genius! Now we'll need to get you back inside Ponyville, Fluttershy.[scribbling][dragging noises]",
    "I know about the Alicorn Amulet. I know you cheated.",
    "Yeah. And I thought you might wanna see what a ''real'' magical amulet looks like. Zecora gave it to me. [muffled] It's from beyond the Everfree Forest, [normal] and it's way more powerful than your measly little Alicorn Amulet!",
    "[muffled] Care to put your amulet where your mouth is? [normal] How about another duel?",
    "That's up to you! But I guess you'll never see the totally awesome magic from beyond the Everfree Forest. Come on, Zecora.",
    "Let's.",
    "No problem. Um, Applejack, Rarity? Could you help me, please?",
    "That's nothing![magic zap]",
    "Duplication spell. Ever see ''one'' pony play ''ten'' instruments?[magic zap]",
    "Ooh, one more. I can turn a mare into a stallion.[magic zap]",
    "Well, Trixie, looks like my amulet is more powerful than yours\u2013 Hey! Give it back!",
    "By the way, Trixie, the amulet around your neck? It's one of Zecora's doorstops.[rock shattering]",
    "You're right. Not even me. Zecora taught me so much about magic while I was in exile. She even taught me when not to use it. My magic alone wasn't powerful enough to take on the Alicorn Amulet head to head, so ''I needed to use a different kind of magic \u2013 the magic of friendship.'' I also knew that the only pony who could get the amulet off your neck was you.",
    "That's not magic. That was just Pinkie Pie.",
    "Trixie?",
    "Hmmm. Sure.",
    "The Tree of Harmony remains one of the most powerful sources of magic known to ponydom. And though it has been at the \"root\" of magic and friendship from the moment it was planted, its ways are mysterious. Almost as if it has a mind of its own.",
    "A tree that grew a castle.",
    "You can all show me what you've learned on tomorrow's test \u2013 \"Friendship's Effect on the Course of Equestrian History\".[students groan]",
    "Remember! Study groups are both fun ''and'' effective![students chattering]",

    "What?! I-",
    "[whispering] Everypony, it's time. Please welcome... the Breezies!",
    "I, for one, am very proud of you, Fluttershy. Leaping into action like that.",
    "We just wanted to see if you thought the Breezies were ready to give it another try.",
    "But they're not going to a cruel world, right? They're going home.",
    "We'll just wait for your word.",
    "I've been studying an old spell book from the Castle of the Two Sisters. There's a spell that I think could help us! This is probably gonna feel a little funny at first, but you're gonna have to trust me.",
    "[high-pitched] Okay, gather round.[magic zaps]",
    "Not a chance.",
    "I have to admit I was a little shocked when Princess Celestia told me she wanted to start a scholastic buckball league. But I was even ''more'' surprised that she wanted the first game to be between her school and ours! Apparently, she's a huge sports fan.",
    "Anyway, we don't have much time. The game is in two weeks, and I want all of you to coach the team![excited chattering]",
    "I know how you feel. Young athletes ready to take the field. Ooh, you could almost breathe in the excitement!",
    "Relax. You're gonna do just fine.",
    "Because I have faith in my friends, who also happen to be the best buckball players in Equestria!",
    "I asked Rainbow Dash to help, too. But I'm not sure when she\u2014[whooshes]",
    "I was thinking of something even ''more'' important.",
    "I knew I could count on your enthusiasm! That's why I want you to coach the cheer squad![thud]",
    "The cheer squad ''is'' important.",
    "Hmmm. Well, maybe this will be a good opportunity for you to find out.",
    "I think you might be surprised. In fact, I'm more sure than ever that you're the perfect choice.",
    "Yahoo!",
    "Of course, and the wings and magical-dampening ring you made seem to be working really well.",
    "Wow, Rainbow Dash! It's almost like you were the perfect pony to coach cheer squad after all!",
    "You mean like how you don't have to care about a thing other ponies like as long as you care about the ponies who like it? Nope. Don't know what you're talking about.",
    "Well, we had initially planned on inviting Rainbow, of course, except\u2013",
    "Yeah, like care and attention, love and affection\u2013 Ugh! And breath mints!",
    "Aren't those all the same thing?",
    "Hm, something's not right here.",
    "Tortoise!",
    "And he's carrying something on his back...",
    "Oh, thank goodness you're not hurt, Rainbow!",
    "But what about the\u2013",
    "Tenacity.",
    "I can think of a few new words.",
    "No, but she is kinda awesome.[elderly ponies chattering][splintering wood]",
    "Call me silly, but I think this whole hero thing might be going to Rainbow Dash's head.",
    "Mm-hm.",
    "Are you taking notes?",
    "Umm, autobiographies are supposed to be written ''by'' the pony they are about.",
    "I must say, I was impressed by that spell she used to fix the dam. Seems like something like that would take quite a bit of study.",
    "Sounds like somepony's jealous.",
    "Yup, we all played Mare Do Well at different times.",
    "And ''I'' used my magic to fix the dam.",
    "Of ''course'' we want you to be a hero.",
    "Celebrating your accomplishments is natural. But...",
    "What we're trying to say is, ''it's great to be really good at something, but it's important to act with grace and humility.''",
    "Sounds like you've got a letter to write to Princess Celestia.",
    "Mm-hmm. You can make it up tomorrow.",
    "A week?! In the middle of the semester?",
    "I'm sorry to hear about your brother, Smolder. But the Dragon Lands are really far for you to go by yourself. And I'm not sure about you missing so much class.",
    "Well, you ''are'' the perfect pony to lead a kindness field trip.[beat]",
    "[sighs] Fine. But I'm gonna expect a full report when you get back.",
    "I was talking to Fluttershy. Hatching season sounds fascinating!",
    "Oh, doesn't that hurt?",
    "I promise.",
    "Give me a break. Everypony already knows how you-",
    "But-",
    "My lips are sealed. Though I'm pretty sure Rarity is gonna pick up on your feelings.[doorbell rings]",
    "She hardly took any pictures.",
    "Oh, Rarity. I'm so sorry. Is there anything we can do?",
    "I'm sure she just got tied up.",
    "Rarity! Fluttershy is your friend.",

    "Of course.",
    "I swear.",
    "Cross my heart and hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my [poke] Ooowwwww!",
    "Oh, really? Well... If you wanna know the truth, Rarity...",
    "Nothing!",
    "I was just thinking. If you really don't like being a model, you could always quit.",
    "But Rarity told me... [gasp][eerie music]",
    "Uhhhhhh!",
    "I guess you're right. [pause] You're right. You're right, you're right, you're right!",
    "Don't you see? On her own, Fluttershy could never do something unattractive. But if I used my magic to help her do something unattractive at her next fashion show, no one will ever want her to model again. And if Fluttershy no longer has to be a model, Rarity will no longer have to be jealous of her. And I'll no longer have to keep their secrets! It's the perfect plan! You can't tell anyone about it. Promise me you won't tell anyone?",
    "So you do promise or you don't?",
    "Obviously.[ponies chattering]",
    "They love you for being you. So all I have to do is make you ''not'' be you. Just leave it to me.[music]",
    "Ugh! But Rarity...!",

    "But... Fluttershy doesn't... Ugh!",

    "''Dear Princess Celestia,''''Being a good friend means being able to keep a secret. But you should never be afraid to share your true feelings with a good friend.'' Did you get all that, Spike?",

    "Exactly. And hopefully my class is learning that on their field trip right now.",

    "This is the only door to Tartarus. The good news is the seal isn't broken, so we know Tirek didn't escape.",
    "Last time I was here, I had to use magic to get in. And according to Star Swirl, all unicorn magic was gone by yesterday's sunset.",

    "I guess it only works once.[door slams][cockatrice hisses]",
    "Star Swirl said that would happen on the second day.",
    "We want answers, Tirek. Magic is disappearing from Equestria.",
    "Where is Equestria's magic going, Tirek? What's making it disappear?",
    "But I thought the fruit bats usually stayed put in the west orchard.",
    "I'm sorry, Fluttershy, but I think Applejack is right. I just wish there was another way we could convince them not to eat them in the first place. Maybe there is...!",
    "So, there's good news and bad news. The good news is that I found a spell that can get the vampire fruit bats to stop wanting to suck the juice from the apples. But in order for the spell to work, I need the bats' full and complete attention.",
    "Fluttershy, I need you to do your Stare on the bats.",
    "But if we ''don't'' do this, there won't be any apples left for anypony here in Ponyville. Doesn't that feel wrong, too?",
    "Alright.[magic humming]",
    "You can stop staring, Fluttershy.",
    "The spell didn't work!",
    "Who is? Fluttershy, you're our animal expert. Do you know of any other creature that might be capable of this?",
    "Well, there's only one way to find out. We'll have to catch whoever it is in the act.",
    "A stakeout...!",
    "That's right. Nopony leaves this orchard until we've solved this mystery. Agreed?",
    "[gasps][slurping]",
    "Applejack, what is it?",
    "We've gotta get her down from there!",
    "Pinkie Pie, calm down! See? She's back on her... branch.",
    "I think this was actually our fault.",
    "Okay, so this is me, these are the bats, and this is Fluttershy doing her Stare. The spell was supposed to go right onto the bats like this, but somehow the spell must have backfired. It took the vampire fruit bats' desire to be vampire fruit bats and transferred that desire into Fluttershy. C'mon! We'll reverse the spell and make it right!",
    "Oh, Fluttershy, where are you?",
    "We'll never get her back unless we corner her and catch her so I can reverse the spell![wolf howling]",
    "[hushed] There she is!",
    "Oh, this is no use. I think the only way we're gonna catch her is if we find a way to lure her closer to us.",
    "[gasps] That's it!",
    "Okay, let's get our friend back. Action stations!",
    "I'm so glad you two could come!",
    "What's wrong?",
    "Ooh! Oh my goodness, I'd love to! We are sadly lacking ''any'' information on dragon culture and customs. I could research them \u2013 maybe even write an article! This could be my chance to make a great contribution to the knowledge of Equestria! [beat] And be there for Spike, heh, of course.",
    "I think we might want something a little more practical this time.",
    "[hushed] It's not supposed to be ''flattering''. It's supposed to blend in!",
    "and",
    "[hushed] This is fascinating! Dragons are notoriously reckless, but they do whatever the Dragon Lord says!",
    "[hushed] When the scepter disappeared, the dragons stopped glowing! We are learning so much!",
    "[hushed] Oh, my gosh!",
    "But what can we do?",
    "and",
    "There has to be another way. It's too dangerous. Besides, if you win, you'd have to stay here!",
    "Well, if you're staying to compete, then we're staying to cheer you on!",

    "Is it just me, or have we seen this crevasse three times already?",
    "[muffled] Look![thump]",
    "[hushed] Awww!",
    "You did well, Spike. With Ember as Dragon Lord, the ponies will be safe and you've gained us a powerful ally.",
    "Plus, Ember said I could write to her anytime I had questions about dragon culture! With this much information, I'll be able to write a whole book on dragons!",
    "and",
    "Ommmmm... Ohhhhhhh mmmmy goodness, I can't handle this! Ooh! Nothing is working! I just have to get it together! Just go in there! And ask! This is your Friendship Festival! Everypony's happiness rests in your hooves. [facehoofs] Ohhhh!",
    "Oh, thank goodness you're here, Spike! I'm just so nervous about this meeting!",

    "Smile?!",
    "Right! [exhales] Good morning, Princesses. Thank you all for seeing me. I have an idea that I think will make our Friendship Festival the most wonderful celebration Equestria has ever seen!",

    "Songbird Serenade's performance is not scheduled to start until after you begin the sunset. And based on my precise calculation, to get the very best lighting for the stage, Princess Celestia, I was hoping you could make sure the sun stays about 28.1\u00ba to the south, and, Princess Luna, if you could raise the moon 62\u00ba to the north at the same time, it would reflect the sunlight on the other side and really frame the entire stage perfectly!",
    "But wait! There's more! Cadance, if you could use your crystal magic to create an aurora above the stage, the sun ''and'' the moon will shine through it and create a truly amazing light show!",
    "Well, I'd do it myself, except I don't have your magic. [snorts]",
    "So... that'd be a no?",
    "Okay, just two hundred and eighteen things left to do and we're ready.",
    "[sighs] Not exactly. They think I can make today perfect without their magic.",

    "''Pinkie!''",

    "Ugh. I just want to go home... Wait a minute... Home! \"Back where you began!\" The Elements must be in... Ponyville! Come on, girls. I'm certain this is what Discord's riddle really meant. If we get back to the library, I have a book that I just know can give us a clue. Ah!",

Maybe even before she's met them.\"''Spike! Spike, it's all so clear! Can't you see? Discord's trying to distract us from what's important. He knows how powerful our friendships are, and he's trying to keep us from seeing it. Do you remember what I said the first day we arrived in Ponyville? I told you that the future of Equestria didn't rest on me making friends. But the ''opposite'' is true! The friendships I've made since I've been here are what saved Equestria from Nightmare Moon. And now they need to save it from Discord!",
    "You're right, Spike. I've got to fight for my friendships. For them. For me. For Equestria!",
    "Oh...uh...why don't you just stay here and rest? I'll take care of the whole fighting for friendship thing myself.",

    "Not as wonderful as friendship.",
    "I'll tell you what we've learned, Discord we've learned that friendship isn't always easy, but there's no doubt it's worth fighting for!",
    "All right, ladies, let's show him what friendship can do!",
    "[sigh] Last one. Thank you so much for helping me clean up all these books, guys. It was a ''crazy'' week of studying.",

    "What are you two arguing about?",
    "What's that?",
    "What's a sonic rainboom?",

    "Go on what?",
    "Owaa! Ugh. How am I supposed to find a flight spell in this mess?",
    "Here it is! A spell that will allow Earth ponies to fly for three days. Ooh, it looks ''really'' difficult... I'm not sure I can do it.",
    "Okay... But who's gonna volunteer to be the test subject?",
    "Here goes. [grunts] [screams]",
    "I think it worked!",
    "I found a spell that makes temporary wings, but it was too difficult to do more than once. So I found an easier spell that lets the rest of us walk on clouds.",
    "Be careful with those wings, Rarity. They're made from gossamer and morning dew, and they're incredibly delicate.",
    "Rarity, we're supposed to be helping Rainbow Dash relax, remember? Put your wings away and stop showing off!",
    "Rainbow Dash, are you okay? You don't look so good.",
    "I loved number seven. Doing fifteen barrel rolls in a row can't be easy.",
    "Oh no! Her wings evaporated into thin air!",
    "[gasp]",
    "Princess.",
    "I did Princess, but I think Rarity learned even more than me.",
    "I like Gabby Gums too, but don't you think she can be a little mean?",
    "\"''Celestia Just Like Us''\"? Gabby Gums doesn't value anypony's privacy.",
    "I just can't help feeling sorry for the ponies featured in her columns. It's gotta be a little embarrassing.",
    "Listen to this one. \"''Twilight Sparkle I Was a Canterlot Snob.'' A well-placed scaly source close to the prissy pony says Twilight Sparkle thinks Ponyville is nothing but muddy roads and low-class rubes.\" Spike!",
    "How could you say such a thing?",

    "\"''Rainbow Dash Speed Demon or Super Softie?''\"?!",

    "We've got to put a stop to this once and for all! Sweetie Belle's on the newspaper staff. Maybe she knows who Gabby Gums is.",
    "Isn't this exciting, Spike? Opening day of cider season!",
    "Still worried about Flim and Flam?",
    "Don't worry, Applejack, I know you'll win tomorrow!",
    "Applejack? Are you sure this is such a good idea?",
    "Well, good luck.",
    "Um, Miss Mayor! Are honorary family members allowed to help in the competition?",
    "Okay, everypony, we're not gonna let those smooth talkers take our friend's farm.",
    "Fluttershy, help Applejack with the trees.",
    "Pinkie Pie, you're on apple catching detail.",
    "Rarity, you've got a discerning eye. Help Granny Smith at the quality control station.",
    "Rainbow Dash, do you think you can help Big McIntosh press?",
    "Alright, everypony, let's save Sweet Apple Acres!",
    "Based on these figures, we're making five barrels for every three of theirs!",

Maybe ''Cogeria'' so they're more... open to suggestion. Oh, or maybe ''Cogeria'' combined with ''Fiducia Compelus''! Yes, that could work nicely! Oh, with a hint of ''Persuadere'' to be sure it sticks.[magic zap]",

    "Fluttershy, where are all the animals?",
    "And why didn't you stop them?",
    "Obviously I wanted you to... Never mind. Can you please round up all the animals in the castle and bring them back here to the foyer?",
    "Did you find a place to chillax, Rainbow Dash?",
    "Great. Let me know when it's ready.",
    "What is that?",
    "[sighs] Go make a ''real'' dress out of fabric, exactly like the one in the book.",
    "Rarity! Make it ''bigger'' than the one in the book.",
    "Pinkie, what are you doing?!",
    "I meant just the one cake! I was only gone a few minutes! How in Equestria did you get all of this done so fast?",
    "Think the baking lesson is done.",
    "Oh, what now?[oven crackling]",
    "What's going on?!",
    "[exhales] I can handle this. It's just magic, and I know magic. What's that?!",
    "What did you say?",
    "We need water!",
    "''Storm'' clouds?![thunder rolling]",
    "[groans] This can't get any worse!",
    "Maybe if I had reversed the ''Fiducia Compelus'' and ''Cogeria''... Or maybe I added too much ''Persuadere''... What?",
    "Well, it was the ''first'' time I cast that particular spell, and I didn't fully think it through. I-I bet if I had reversed\u2014",
    "Well, when you put it that way, it sounds really bad.",
    "[stammering]",
    "Ugh, fine! I've been avoiding the friendship lessons on purpose.",
    "I can cast complex spells, but baking a cake with Pinkie Pie freaks me out! And yes, I know how ridiculous that sounds. That's why I didn't say anything. I thought if I just kept wowing you with my magical abilities, you might just... not... notice?",
    "Yes! Baking a cake, sewing \u2013 all of it! What if I was bad at it? I didn't want to be a disappointment to anypony, and I ended up being a disappointment to everypony.",
    "But the lesson\u2014",
    "Oh. You know, I think I might have missed the point here.",
    "So now what?",
    "Yeah, about that... Things got a little out of hand last night.",
    "I ''really'' messed up. I cast the spell because I was nervous about working with you on the friendship lessons.",
    "Believe me, I know. What I did was wrong, a-and I can't take it back. You're right to be upset, and I hope one day I can make it up to you. But all I can say is... I'm sorry. Now, if you'll excuse me, I've gotta go clean the castle covered in wet cake batter and spiders.",
    "[sighs] I'm just lucky to have such understanding friends, but it's probably going to be a while before I try to tackle those friendship lessons again.",
    "What are you talking about? I've been cleaning up the mess I made by totally failing at friendship.",
    "Yes, but\u2014",
    "Sun \u2013 check. Chairs \u2013 check. And thanks to a simple ''Catadupa Levitata'' spell, we've got water. Is that everything we need to chillax?",
    "No? What did I miss?",
    "Ah! Right.",
    "So... How long do we sit quietly?",
    "Ha! Straight to the changeling hive! I told you I could do it.",
    "[scoffs] It's like twelve steps away. Before Chrysalis' throne was destroyed, the closest magic would've gotten us was waaaaaaay over there. On a scale of one to ten, how happy do you think Thorax is gonna be about our surprise visit?",

    "He's dealing with the wants and needs of his subjects. Redesigning the hive, a dread maulwurf wreaking havoc outside...",
    "The dread maulwurf? Sure it is. Thorax said it's like half-bear, half-mole, half-raging-pile-of-claws! But now that the changelings don't feed on the love of everything around them, plants have started to grow back. But this maulwurf keeps eating them all up.",
    "[meakly] Nope.",
    "Nope.[dun-dun-dun]{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}[suspenseful music]",

    "Your brother?",
    "Oh, yeah. You guys have the same... um... eye shape?",
    "I am really impressed, Thorax. The hive, all the activities...",
    "Seriously, Thorax. What is up with your brother?",
    "[encouragingly] Hmm?",
    "We know a thing or two about what it's like to be outsiders. Maybe we could talk to him for you.",

    "Right. [clears throat] So... not a big fan of the vines, huh?",

    "It wasn't great.",
    "I... [sighs] I want to say something, but it goes against everything I've been taught as Twilight's pupil.",

    "Ugh![transformation noise]",
    "Thorax, we have something to tell you.",
    "Actually, Thorax, um, never mind! C'mon, Trixie, we've got a... thing to do.",
    "Maybe we don't have to. Get Pharynx and meet me at the hive entrance. I'll explain everything.[magic zap]",
    "We'll just use one problem to solve another. I switched the trail of plants around to lure the maulwurf here. The changelings may not be able to stop it anymore, but Pharynx certainly can. When it attacks, he'll save his brother, showing everypony his good side, the others will accept him, and Pharynx will finally let love and friendship into his life and transform! [pants]",
    "I know, right? Great idea? Where's Pharynx?",
    "Gone like gone to the throne room?",

    "And the dread maulwurf is coming this way![changelings screaming]",
    "[nervous laugh] I might have relaid them to lead it back toward the hive.",
    "I thought if Pharynx saw you were in danger, the loving, caring side of him would come out when he protected you!",
    "I'm coming with you!",
    "Oh, ''sure'', you could all stay here, not help Pharynx and he won't bother you anymore. It's your choice. But remember when you didn't ''have'' a choice! When you were forced to obey Chrysalis! You might have been unstoppable, but you weren't free to choose! And now you are, because of Thorax! Well, it's his brother out there, and now it's your chance to prove you're just as strong embracing love as you were feeding on it! Now is your chance to show what changelings can really be! Not because you ''have'' to, but because you ''choose'' to!",

    "[sighs] This castle looked a lot smaller from the outside.[door opens][brushing]",

    "Oh. Thanks!",
    "Sorry I'm late. I got a little turned around. I still can't believe you're letting me stay here... as your pupil... after everything I did.",

    "What do you mean it increases the Crystal Heart's power?",

    "Sunburst?",

    "[laughs nervously] ...Yeah.[door opens][clatter][magic noises][door closes][door opens][beat]",
    "Ugh! I am never gonna find my way around this place!",

    "[sighs] [narrating] ''When we were foals, Sunburst knew everything there was to know about magic. He always knew just what to do. And he was always there to help me.

    "Not really stuff I'm super eager to tell Sunburst about. I mean, he's probably some big important wizard now, and... I can't even find my way around Twilight's castle.",
    "I know. But I don't want her to think I'm not ready to learn or that I'm not grateful for everything she's doing.",
    "Great...[train whistle]",
    "Wow, this Crystalling sounds pretty important. I'd understand if you wanted to... you know... wait to do a different friendship lesson when we get back.",

    "[laughs nervously][train chuffing]",

    "Fine. What's the next thing on the list?",
    "I'm pretty sure we can skip that.",
    "Sunburst?",
    "It's... It's me, Starlight. We used to be friends?",
    "Me? Oh! You know, some of this, some of that, different... stuff. Right now, I'm sort of Twilight Sparkle's new pupil.",
    "Heh... yeah... that's actually kind of why I'm here. I mean, I know you're probably very busy.",
    "Well, I figured after magic school, you'd go on to do important wizard work, but...",
    "Well, I guess that's that!",
    "[groans][knocking][door opens]",
    "Heh, I know. Weird, right?",
    "What?[thump]",
    "No! I-I don't see what that has to do with anything. W-Why would you even ask that?[tea pouring]",
    "I mean, did something happen to ''you'' after you left for magic school?",
    "But it's a surprise gift for her coronation, and I know you're uncomfortable not telling the truth, soooo...",
    "[imitating Twilight Sparkle] Oh, hi there, Applejack! It's always so great to see you! But why did you ask me to come out to the farm?",
    "Applejack, are you trying to ruin the surprise?",

    "I suppose you should say something, but it doesn't have to be a lie. You can talk about anything. We just need more memories.[door creaks]",

Three one-thousand-piece puzzles, one copy of ''Dragon Pit'' \u2013 the best board game in the history of ponies \u2013 my famous collection of campfire spices, and an inflatable raft. Did I forget something? I could pop back to the castle and grab it.",
    "Yeah, maybe we don't need the raft.",

    "[flatly] But if you're there, who's in here?[poof]",
    "Oh, no. It might make me thirsty, and we don't have anything to drink. So...",

    "What? No! I do like it. I mean, if you like it, I like it. Besides, we've almost looked at everything, right?",
    "This shop looked a lot smaller from the outside.[montage music continues]",
    "[joins laughter, sighs] Um, I-I really like this old-timey barrel.",
    "Wait. You don't know what you bought?",
    "Mm. [chuckles, sighs]",
    "Well, I don't know if you're gonna remember this, but...",
    "Dragon Pit!",
    "Sunburst would get so excited whenever his dragon got trapped, he knocked the whole board over.",
    "Uh-oh! Somepony's dragon's gonna get trapped![rumble][boing][marble rolling]",
    "[chuckle]",
    "I hope you're enjoying your visit so far.",
    "Oh. Yeah. She's pretty great.",
    "Well, she is the Princess of Friendship.",
    "So tomorrow I thought\u2014",
    "You two are pretty similar. I don't know many ponies who are fluent in Olde Ponish.",
    "Right...",
    "Um... sure.",
    "Um...[door closes]",
    "...Good night.[door opens]",
    "[singsong] Knock, knock!",
    "Yup! Maybe a bit early, but like you said, there's a lot to see in Ponyville.",
    "Plus, I couldn't really sleep. I just kept thinking about all the stuff ''we'' have in common and how much fun we'll have today.",
    "Actually, I'm pretty sure she's busy with princess stuff today.",
    "But I've got a full day of stuff planned. Just you and me.",
    "Oh! Right! Sorry. [laughs nervously][door closes][fly buzzing]",
    "One genuine Sweet Apple Acres apple tree! Because we used to drink so much apple juice as foals?",
    "Really? I mean, it was all we drank. Here. Try an apple. I bet that'll jog your memory. [grunts][thunk]",
    "Trixie? What are you doing here?",
    "Oh. Well, Sunburst and I were just catching up, so\u2014",
    "[sighs] Why not?",
    "[sarcastic] Gee. I don't know.",
    "I know Trixie's \"magic\" is, you know, fun. But the Mirror Pool is ''actual'' magic.",
    "Yup. I mean, it's supposed to be all dangerous, and I guess I shouldn't have broken the seal to get in, but you wanted to see the sights of Ponyville, right?",
    "Mm-hmm. If we made copies of ourselves, we could get a year's worth of hanging out over in one day.[beat]",
    "Uh, not that we would.[tapping]",
    "Oh. I hope it's not a leftover Pinkie Pie.",
    "Maud! How did you get in here?",
    "Maud isn't super chatty. I mean, you and I could sit around and talk all day, but she looks pretty busy.",
    "[coughing]",
    "[sighs][montage music continues][bubbling][squeaking][ting!][tapping]",
    "[mumbles \"I don't know\"] Doing stage magic with Trixie? Studying new rocks with Maud? You're here, so I guess you two aren't off translating some ancient Olde Ponish text.",
    "I thought so, too, but it hasn't worked out that way. When we were foals, we had more in common than any two ponies in Equestria. But now, it seems like he's got more in common with my friends than he does with me.[clunk]",
    "Magic?",
    "[gasps] You're right! Thanks, Twilight! You're the best!",
    "Maud does have a way of making rocks really interesting, but I wanted to work on something a little more \"us\".",
    "Just a little something I made up.",
    "Yup![magic zap][wind whirling]",
    "I know, right? But wait, there's more![magic zap][wind whirling]",
    "Nothing. I was trying to have fun doing the ''one'' thing I thought we still had in common, but I guess we don't even have that anymore.",
    "[sighs] I appreciate you trying to help, Twilight. But it seems pretty clear that Sunburst and I have grown apart.",
    "I created a spell so we could relive playing a game in our childhood home... and bodies.",
    "I'm just not sure Sunburst wants to stay friends, too.",
    "I thought you didn't want to play this game.",
    "Actually, it's missing something.[magic zap][cracking]",
    "[giggles] Now it's fun.",
    "I don't know why I got so worried about us not having anything in common.",
    "What made it even better was getting to play it with ''all'' my friends.",
    "You bet. I want to hear if you find anything interesting in that barrel.",
    "It could be because you're just yelling \"teacup!\" and not picturing it in your mind.",
    "What does your teacup look like? What shape is it? What color?",
    "Hey!",
    "[groans]",
    "Trixie! You ruined my teacakes!",
    "[chuckles] Good job, Trix. But I was baking these to give to Twilight and the girls for their friendship retreat. Pinkie Pie gave me a recipe and everything.",
    "[exhales] Not exactly.{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}[train whistle blows]",
    "And I promised Trixie we'd practice more magic. It might be better if the castle was empty, if you know what I mean.",
    "[nervous laughter]",
    "We'll take good care of the castle while you're gone.",
    "[hushed] They're gonna bond, share laughs, and if I know them, they're gonna sing a song.",
    "[giggles] Shhh!",
    "[nervously] Here, I, um, brought you snacks...",
    "It was supposed to be teacakes, but... [sighs] it's a long story. Have a great time!",
    "Okay, Trixie, what kinds of spells did you want to work on next?",
    "Hmmm. Nothing just disappears, so that's technically a teleportation spell, and those are pretty hard. Maybe we should start with something smaller.",
    "Well, I've always found magic is tied to my emotions. Whatever I'm feeling fuels whatever I'm doing, and the stronger I'm feeling, the stronger the magic.",
    "Yep. Thanks for bringing that up.",
    "Teleportation spell.",
    "[laughs] I guess we can give it a whirl. Now, we just need to find you something to teleport.",
    "Uh, let's pick something, I don't know, not living?",
    "[groans]",
    "If you master this spell before the girls get back, you'd be setting some kind of record!",
    "Okay. What you want to do is concentrate on the object that you want to teleport...",
    "No, Trix, wait, not just\u2014[magic zap]",
    "[groans][thud]",
    "[hyperventilating] No-no-no-no-no-no-no! You made Twilight's friendship map disappear!",
    "Really?!",
    "Trixie, we ''have'' to get that map back.",
    "Twilight's never gonna trust me to be alone in this castle again! What were you thinking?!",
    "No! You're supposed to concentrate on the object, not just teleporting!",
    "I tried. [gasps] I... need a minute.[dishes clattering][door opens][crockery shattering]",
    "I will be once I cast a spell to contain my anger in this bottle.",
    "Do you see this storm cloud? This has never happened before! All this magical energy has to go ''somewhere'', and if I'm not using it to fight a magical duel or bend my friends' wills to obey my every command...",
    "The point is, I don't know what my magic's going to do. So I'm hoping if I bottle up my anger, I won't do who-knows-what to Trixie.",
    "What choice do I have? I've got to get that map back, and I don't wanna lose Trixie. If she knew what I was thinking right now, she'd probably never talk to me again.",
    "Trixie!",
    "[groans][magic warbling]",
    "[exhales] Nope! [laughs nervously] Not mad at all! So, the map is probably in the last place you were thinking of. Where was that?",
    "[groans] No worries. We'll just take a walk around town. Maybe that'll jog your memory.",
    "Did you remember?",
    "Cinnamon... nuts?[magic warbling]",
    "That's a good idea!",
    "[exhales] You got this, Starlight...",
    "Have you seen a big table? Magical map on it, sometimes glowing cutie marks shoot out?",
    "No! We don't have time for this! Twilight and the girls are gonna be back soon![magic warbling]",
    "But I'm not upset. What's our next stop?",
    "Are you sure? It's really, really important that we find it. And it might be here because ''somepony''...[magic warbling]",
    "...was craving apples.",
    "Granny Smith, ''please''. The table?",
    "[sighs][teapot poodle yapping]",
    "[tired] Okay, we better start moving if we want to make it to the Crystal Empire.",
    "[groans][magic warbling]",
    "[tired] Nope. I am great.",
    "[weakly] No.",
    "[weakly] No!",
    "[weakly] Don't!",

    "[grunting] I can't...!{{#lstBest Friends Until the End of Time|song2}}",
    "[weakly] They're not. I am.[magic warbling and rumbling]",
    "[sighs] I'm really... mad at you. You lost Twilight's map table. You make jokes like it's no big deal. It's like you don't even care you could get me in a lot of trouble. If we can't find that table, Twilight's ''never'' going to trust me again, and the worst part is ''you didn't even say you were sorry!''",
    "Yeah! I do! [sighs] But to be fair, I don't know how you could have known. I did a spell and bottled up my anger, but when the bottle broke, it infected these three. I'm really sorry. I used magic so I wouldn't use magic. I should have guessed that would backfire.",
    "I didn't want to lose you as a friend.",
    "And a magical temper tantrum?",
    "[giggles] I'll forgive you if you forgive me.",
    "You're kidding me.",

    "Welcome home, Twilight!",
    "Without the rainboom, you and your friends will ''never'' form your special cutie mark bond!",
    "Not bad, but it's gonna take a lot more than ''that''!",
    "You've ''really'' gotta work on your aim.[many magic zaps]",

    "Well, good luck!",
    "[clapping][squeaks][splatting][magic zap][magic zap][sound of machinery][magic zap][magic zap]",
    "Up for another race-ending fight, Twilight?",
    "If that's what it takes to keep you and your ''friends'' from getting your cutie mark connection, then I'm game![magic zap]",
    "Oh, next I suppose you'll tell me that \"the fate of all of Equestria hangs in the balance\"!",
    "Spare me your overblown ego! No group of friends, not even Princess Twilight's, is ''that'' important![magic zap]",
    "Where are we?!",
    "But there's nothing here!",
    "I don't believe you!",
    "Change my mind? You don't know anything about me! I was perfectly happy before ''you'' and your ''friends'' ruined what I built!",

    "That map of yours is connected to every part of Equestria, and this part is my home.[young Starlight Glimmer clapping]",
    "Sunburst and I did everything together. In fact, I don't remember us ever being apart. Until today.[rumbling][myriad thumps]",
    "And just like that, my friend was gone. His family recognized his magical talent and sent him off to Canterlot. I never saw him again.",
    "Because of his cutie mark! He got his, and I didn't! He moved on, and I didn't! I stayed here and never made another friend because I was too afraid another cutie mark would take them away, too!",
    "Not everypony's lucky enough to get her cutie mark at the same time as her friends![magic zaps][magic zaps]",
    "You don't know what it's like to lose a friend because of a cutie mark. But once I stop the rainboom, you will![magic zaps]",
    "And when I destroy this scroll, there'll be no way for you to change it![paper ripping]",
    "I only saw what you showed me! Who knows what'll ''really'' happen?",
    "Ugh! What's ''so special'' about your friends?! How can a group of ponies that are so different be so important?!",
    "I thought Sunburst and I were the same. But we turned out different, and it tore our friendship apart!",
    "How do I know they won't all end the same way?",
    "[gulps, exhales] I know there's no excuse for what I did, but I want you all to know that I'm ready for whatever punishment you think is fair.",
    "I know first-hoof how true that can be.",
    "[hushed] How do I start?",
    "What?",
    "Oh, I heard \"set the table\" and just kinda went for it.",
    "Should I... change it back?",
    "If it's just you, me, and Princess Celestia, why are there ''four'' seats?",
    "Well, I can't choose. I like all your friends.",
    "New friends? Hey, maybe I'll just force friendships by magically enslaving the entire population of Ponyville!",

    "Sorry...",
    "Oh, that's too bad. I love a good conversation.[magic wisps]",
    "I can't be friends with somepony who doesn't talk.",
    "...And I guess my first instinct shouldn't be to magically command ponies to act the way I want them to?",
    "Alright, I'll change him back!",
    "I'm glad you all got past ''my'' first impression.",
    "You really think a new outfit will help me meet ponies?",
    "When will it be ready?",
    "Dinner's tomorrow.",
    "Ugh! Maybe not.",
    "Like you?",
    "Who's that?",

    "[nervously] Enslaving villages, I guess...",
    "You're adorable, but probably not what Twilight had in mind.",
    "[groan] What is going on? This is Ponyville! If I can't make a friend here, there's gotta be something wrong with ''me''! [sighs] Okay, calm down. Nobody makes friends with a total stresscase.[more ponies chattering]",
    "[to herself] Stop stressing... ''Stop stressing!''[long beat][door opens and shuts]",
    "[sighs] This is ''just'' what I needed.",
    "You ever have one of ''those'' days?",
    "[giggles]",
    "I'm not from here either. I've been trying to make friends, but it's not easy. They're not saying it, but I think everypony knows about my past. I may have been a tiny bit... completely and utterly evil?",
    "Finally, a pony I can relate to.",
    "Twilight, guess what? I made a new friend!",
    "She's great!",
    "She's powerful!",
    "She's\u2014",
    "You know each other?",
    "[hushed] That's kind of a mouthful.",
    "But whatever she did, you've forgiven her, right?",
    "Well, you did say anypony, and I just assumed that you'd trust me to make my own friends the way Princess Celestia trusted ''you''.",
    "Thanks, Twilight! You won't regret it!",
    "That's what I'm worried about.",
    "What is it?",
    "Are you kidding? You're the first pony I've met who has any idea how I feel!",
    "What are friends for?",
    "[hushed] Your secret's safe with me.",
    "Maybe I can help. I'm pretty good at organizing stuff. Magic props, brainwashed crowds...",
    "and",
    "Uh, I'll catch up. I think there's something in my hoof.",
    "[sarcastically] Great. Thanks for asking in a completely not creepy way.",
    "[deadpan] Nice to meet you.",
    "So back at your castle when you said \"I trust you\", you meant \"I ''don't'' trust you\".",
    "[sighs] I appreciate it, but you're wrong about Trixie. She's just like me. We have a real connection.",
    "Please, Twilight! I know you're trying to help, but I need to make friends on my own if I'm going to become a better pony.",
    "Wow. Trixie was right. You're not really giving her a second chance. I wonder what that says about how you feel about me.",
    "[groans][thump][dragging]",
    "I was thinking. You said Twilight is better than you at everything, but that's not true. You're better at magic.",
    "I meant ''stage'' magic.",
    "That sounds very...",
    "I was gonna say cool!",
    "Not if you could use real magic.",
    "No, I mean, I could help! You could start the trick, and right before you got chewed up, I could use magic to save you...[magic zap]",
    "...and make you appear in the black box!",
    "Hah. When it comes to magic, I don't make mistakes. Maybe I could be your... magic show helper pony!",
    "Well, I'd be honored.",
    "[groans] I can't! Tonight's this incredibly important dinner with Twilight.",
    "Can I vent for a minute?",
    "Even after Twilight ''says'' she trusts me, she clearly doesn't trust me enough to choose my own friends. [sighs] I guess you were right. No second chances.",
    "[sighs] I'm so glad we're not at that boring dinner.",
    "Yes, but\u2014",
    "You win? That sounds like you just made friends with me to beat Twilight.",
    "I should've known. Nopony else in Ponyville wanted to be my friend. Why would you? [controlled sobbing]",
    "But... what if Trixie really ''was'' using me just to one-up you?",
    "Stay with your buddy! No running! Just follow Counselor Trixie!",
    "I have to go. You got this?",
    "You didn't make an appointment! [yells][teleportation zap][teleportation zap]",

    "Somewhere you can't hurt anypony!",

    "Aah![teleportation zap]",
    "Put it on my tab![teleportation zap][zap!][rumbling]",
    "Aah! Ugh! [groaning]",
    "Wait. You can't command ponies' attention because your mane's messed up?",
    "[gasps]",
    "Hard.",
    "Didn't you say Zecora was working on a cure?",
    "The thing is, it's pretty much like Zecora said. Fixing manes with magic is\u2014",
    "Huh?",
    "But it has to come from somewhere.",
    "Uh-uh. I think we can both say that's not a good option.",
    "Um, Rarity, what are you doing?",
    "[gasps]",
    "Welcome home, Twilight![magic zaps]",
    "[laughs] I'd tell you, but I don't want to ''ruin'' the surprise! Won't be needing ''that'' anymore. [laughs][magic zaps][clocks ticking][magic zaps]",
    "Aw, sorry about this.[magic zap]",
    "You are about to find out.[magic zaps][magic zaps]",
    "Well, ''finding'' her will be easy! But ''stopping'' her's gonna be harder than you think. Sorry to disappoint you, but I created that spell to send ''myself'' back in time. So even when ''you'' cast it, ''I'' still get sent back here. It wasn't difficult to change Star Swirl's spell. He'd already done the hard part. But figuring out I could use the map to go to any time or place ''and'' pull you along with me? [short laugh] I even impressed ''myself'' with that. I ''knew'' you'd try to stop me. You're ''so'' predictable. Why else would I leave the scroll behind? Touching it triggered the map to whisk you here and watch me ''erase'' the one thing that linked you with your friends! My village was a sanctuary of equality, where nopony's cutie mark allowed them to feel superior! It was a special place, and ''you'' and your ''friends'' took it away![beat]",
    "Now it's ''my'' turn to take something special from ''you''! Without the rainboom, you and your friends will ''never'' form your special cutie mark bonds! Cutie marks for cutie marks! Sounds like a fair trade to me![tok][crystal shattering]",
    "Just remember how you'd feel if someone said those things to you.",
    "Oh, I was just reminding these two colts how ''hurtful'' teasing can be.",
    "Of course! In a world where everypony is unique, some are bound to feel more special than others. But that isn't a license to be cruel, is it?",
    "Oh, isn't it a shame we don't live in a world where everypony is equal? No one would ever tease anyone there! Wouldn't that be nice?",
    "Oh, that's not true. I convinced them not to be bullies because everypony should be equal. Stopping the rainboom is just a bonus.[whoosh]",
    "If you say so!",
    "Gee, Twilight, what's the matter? Couldn't convince her to do the ''impossible''? That's too bad.",
    "What? Really?! Are you attacking my friend because you want to be in a book?!",
    "Collecting these memories for Twilight is really going well. I hope she likes the scrapbook.",
    "Nope, it's just me. Reading.[pages flipping]",
    "Pinkie, I don't ''have'' a closet. Is everything okay?",
    "And ruin her surprise party?",
    "Oh, she probably just found a new rock formation and forgot you two were gonna hang out. Tell ya what. You take care of the cake, and I'll look for Maud.",
    "Wow. Maud has a boyfriend?",
    "So does Maud.",
    "Yep, that's Maud.",
    "Uh, that also sounds like Maud.",
    "Well, Maud obviously likes ''something'' about him.",
    "Maybe you just need to spend more time with him. Find out what you have in common.",
    "You both care about Maud. I know. He could help you with her party.",
    "And I'll keep Maud busy while you and Mudbriar plan the best surprise birthday ever.",
    "Huh. You must be Mudbriar.[beat]",
    "I'm Starlight Glimmer. Nice to meet you. I've heard great things![beat]",
    "I'm so glad the two of you are spending time together. So... how's it going?",
    "Hey, Mudbriar, have you ever flown a kite? Let me tell you all about it. See, the first thing you should do is\u2014",
    "Uh, wait, let's all slow down and talk about this.",
    "I think you really spruce up the office, Ms. Philodendron. [gasps] Oh! I'm gonna call you Phyllis! [baby talk] Don't you look good, Phyllis![knock on door]",
    "[baby talk] Come in![door opens]",
    "[clears throat] I mean, uh, come in!",
    "No! Why? [nervous laugh]",
    "If this is about leaving early yesterday, I didn't have any students on my schedule, and Trixie was having a magical emergency, which actually turned out to be nothing\u2014",
    "I know! It's just so... amazing! I'm a little... Do you think I'm really up for it? Of course you do. I've covered for you every time you've had to run off and save Equestria, but... I mean... Yes. Of course! Thank you! [squeals][thud]",
    "I'm a little nervous. And excited. I'm mostly just nervous.",
    "Wow. I mean, no biggie. Right, Phyllis? I've totally got this.[shatter!]",
    "[nervous laugh]{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}",
    "Thanks...?",
    "What do you mean?",
    "Obviously our lunch is super important, but so is taking over the school. And the only pony who's really ''run'' the School of Friendship is the ''Princess'' of Friendship. And I'm worried about doing it all alone, so I want to get as much advice from Twilight as I can while she's still here.",
    "But that just gave me an idea! Thanks, Trixie! You can give good advice when you don't mean to.",
    "Okay... Uh, I know how busy you are, but I wanted to talk to you about running the school because, honestly, I was a bit worried about taking it over all on my own. But I just realized ''you'' never did it alone.",
    "Exactly! So, what do you think about me hiring a vice headmare to help run things?",
    "Really?",
    "Uh, why?",
    "Uh, well, sure, that would be fun, but I can't just give you the job.",
    "Exactly. I'll probably interview several ponies.",
    "Why do you keep saying \"wink\"?",
    "[nervous laugh]",
    "I'm glad you all decided to be a part of the search for the School of Friendship's vice headmare.",
    "Well, that's not the primary responsibility of the vice headmare. But anypony is welcome to apply. I think the selection process I've come up with is pretty special.",
    "[clears throat] Since you all have to prove you have what it takes to be vice headmare, I've designed the interview in three stages. Each stage will test a different skill the vice headmare needs. Only those who do well will move through the stages until finally the best candidate rises to the top! So, without further ado, it's time for stage one \u2013 substituting for the teachers!",
    "[groans]",
    "[groans]",
    "Okay, Phyllis. Obviously those three are moving on. But what about the rest? Mm-hmm. I think we're in agreement on this one. [sighs] I know what you're gonna say. But it would be so much fun to have my vice headmare be a friend. She just needs a little more hoof-holding than some of the others, but it could still work out, right?[door opens]",
    "See? I told you it could work. [groans]",
    "All right, remaining vice headmare candidates. Welcome to stage two! All of you are here because you performed well \u2013 or well enough \u2013 to face your next challenge \u2013 parent/teacher conferences! The vice headmare will need to be a master communicator, and I can't think of a better test of that than meeting with our students and their parents or guardians.",
    "Trixie, what happened?!",
    "I really appreciate your honesty, Big Mac, and you're right. Parents expect a lot of detailed communication when it comes to their kids. And if you aren't comfortable with that, vice headmare probably isn't the job for you.",
    "Uh, good.",
    "Trixie, that's not exactly what I wanted to talk to you about. You can't get into a shouting match with parents or guardians. For the final stage of the interview process, you'll each have to put together a field trip. And if you really do want the job, I need yours to be exceptional. Because if I had to pick a vice headmare right now, it wouldn't be you.",
    "[groans] Trixie, I\u2014",
    "Is it wrong for me to think she might actually pull it off?[beat]",
    "[groans] Don't answer that.",
    "Not looking forward to the performance?",
    "Trixie, what did you do?!",
    "Trixie, go with the students! I'll handle this!",
    "and",
    "We'll talk about it later![magic sounds][boom!]",
    "[bitterly] Yes.",
    "Are you kidding? I don't know what team ''you're'' on, but it isn't mine. This was a disaster. It was dangerous.",
    "It wasn't even acceptable! You went from not taking it seriously to blowing things so out of proportion you put everycreature in danger! And I wanted to work with a friend so much, I ignored the fact that you would never be right for the job!",
    "I'm saying you'll never be vice headmare!",
    "Why would you think that?! I created the position because I need ''help''! But I can't think of any way that you would ever help me!",
    "Oh-ho. That's because Twilight's friends are competent! They care about what they are doing! ''And'' they know how to do it!",
    "A lot better now.",
    "I really wanted it to be a friend, so I ended up pushing aside some pretty big signs that it wasn't gonna work out.",
    "What if you and your friend can't figure it out?",
    "So, I guess that means talking to them at the beginning instead of stringing them along until you get so frustrated you totally lose it and say a bunch of really awful things?",
    "[sighs][knock on door]",
    "Trixie? I know you're in there.",
    "I'm sorry for all those things I said. I just really wanted it to work out, even though I knew it probably wouldn't. I should have said something sooner.",
    "You aren't terrible. And you have a lot of great qualities. Maybe not vice headmare qualities, but great and powerful friend qualities.[door opens]",
    "Well, you really stand by the ponies you care about. Gallus even said nocreature's ever stuck up for him the way you did with Grampa Gruff. It would have been nice to run the school together, but not everypony is right for every job.",
    "If it makes you feel any better, nopony was.",
    "Well, Dr. Hooves has decided to go back to his experiments, and Octavia is worried the responsibilities of vice headmare will take too much time away from her music. Maybe getting a vice headmare was a bad idea.",
    "But who could it be?",
    "It would be nice if I got along with them, since having it be a friend can't work out.",
    "But what about being Flurry Heart's Crystaller?",
    "Are you kidding?! You're hired!",
    "Oh, Trixie, thank you so much.",
    "More than that, actually. You really did give good advice. And you helped me talk through the problem of finding the right pony for the job. And we know you care about the students.",
    "\"Friend\" is perfect. But there's a position here at the school you might be right for, too. What would you say to being the School of Friendship's new student counselor?",
    "''Phyllis, no!''[credits]{{Transcripts}}[[esTranscripciones/La Poni Ideal]]{{Infobox Transcript}}[zoom]",

    "I trust you had a pleasant night? This way, please. There are some ''friends'' who'd like to see you. Gather round, friends, gather round! We've come to ask if any of you are ready to join us! There are so many friends to be made once you realize you don't need your cutie marks or the talents that come with them.",
    "It's all right, everypony. This is a perfectly normal part of the equalization process for those who haven't... quite seen the light yet. We'll try again tomorrow once you've had a bit more time to consider our philosophy!",
    "We have a new friend, everypony![ponies chattering]",
    "Now, there's one more order of business. It seems some in our midst might be... dissatisfied with the village life![ponies gasping]",
    "Unfortunately, it's all too true, my friends! [to Fluttershy] Will you kindly tell us the names of those ''friends'' who so desperately miss their cutie marks that they would sneak around in the shadows talking to strangers about it? Just so we can be sure your intentions are indeed pure.",
    "Nonsense! Obviously these ponies must have asked you directly. Kindly point them out!",
    "And you're quite certain it was ''only'' you?",
    "And no thought to the pain you'd cause your friends. Such selfishness.",
    "[over loudspeaker] ''To excel is to fail.'' [continues under]",
    "Come. All new friends stay with me until their cottage is completed. Let's get you settled, and then you can enjoy all that our little village has to offer.[rumbling]",

    "Ugh! Starlight, you clumsy foal!",
    "I've got a good feeling about today! So, do any of you have anything you'd like to say? Aw, pity. Well, let's try this again tomorrow, shall we? No new friends today, I'm afraid!",
    "Marvelous, Fluttershy! That's the spirit! Party Favor, will you join us, please?",
    "It seems there's cause for celebration after all!",
    "Such backwards thinking.",
    "Well done, Party Favor! We welcome you back with open hooves!",
    "Is this true?",
    "Just look around! Equality has given us more happiness than you've ever known!",
    "Out of the question. A pony with a different cutie mark in our midst would destroy our entire philosophy. We are all equal here![crowd muttering]",

    "Wha... What are you looking at?! They're the problem, not me!",
    "They do! Don't you see?! Look at them!",
    "I... I had to, you fools! How could I collect your cutie marks without my magic?!",
    "The staff is a piece of wood I found in the desert! It's ''my'' magic that makes all this possible! You'd all still be living your miserable lives thinking you're better than everypony else if it weren't for ''my'' magical abilities! ''I'' brought you friendship! ''I'' brought you equality! ''I created harmony!''",
    "So what? E-Everything else I said is true! The only way to be happy is if we're all equal!",
    "''QUIET!''",
    "They think they can come to ''my'' village and disrupt ''my'' life? Let's see how they like spending the rest of their lives without their precious cutie marks!",
    "Are you all so willing to give up everything because of these ''strangers''?![snow thudding]",
    "Wh\u2013 I studied that spell for years! How can you\u2014",
    "Spare me your sentimental nonsense! I gave these ponies real friendships they never could've had otherwise!",
    "I wondered how long you'd take to get tired of pillow-fort pouting.",
    "[short laugh] I'm not gonna cheer you up. I'm gonna tell you what you did wrong.",
    "You gave up too easily.[beat]",
    "Hey, you made me a guidance counselor. That means tough love.",
    "So was I when you met me. But you showed me that when you know in your heart something is right, you stand up for it. You did that for me. Why not for this?",
    "And ''you're'' in charge of all the ''friendship'' in Equestria. Why should you let somepony else stop you from doing your job?",
    "Doesn't matter! You can write your own rules! Because you are doing something new. Something important!",
    "Now, ''that's'' the Twilight I know. How can I help?",
    "Unless they used some kind of spell to disappear.",
    "You know, this probably isn't the safest place for a campout.",
    "Guess I make a pretty good guidance counselor, huh?",
    "Uh, I don't. What's so exciting about a toy crown?",
    "Guess that explains your love of charts and so much else.",
    "Guess I'll watch the school?{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}[door opens]",
    "Lucky for her, she's not alone!",
    "Uh, Twilight? Are you okay?",
    "[scoffs] You didn't know that was gonna happen.",
    "Maybe there's another way.",
    "That's great. Heh. But I was thinking of another way that maybe doesn't involve banishing at all?",
    "Uh, I know I'm not as experienced as all of you, but is banishment really the only option? I mean, it's been a long time. Maybe the Pony of Shadows is ready to talk?",
    "But we could try.",
    "[sighs] I know Star Swirl is a great wizard, but this whole plan seems... wrong. The map's only ever sent us to solve friendship problems.",
    "Honestly? We don't know anything about him.",
    "That's not entirely true.[squeaking][grinding]",
    "You all knew the Pony of Shadows before he became what he is now. You must've been friends. So what happened?",
    "But ''why'' did he steal the artifacts from you?",
    "Hmm...[door opens]",
    "That looks like a lot of work.",
    "Banish Stygian to limbo. I get it.",
    "And I'm just trying to figure out why.",
    "I know from experience that's not always true. When the map called you six to my village, it was for a friendship problem. Are you sure this is different?",
    "I guess I'm lucky your idol wasn't around when you decided to be my friend. I might've been banished to limbo, too.[door closes]",
    "I really hope Twilight knows what she's doing...",
    "Are you still sure this isn't a friendship problem?",
    "Because it's what she does. I wasn't so different from you, and Twilight helped me change. If there's one pony in Equestria that can save a friendship, it's her.",
    "Twilight![magic zap]",
    "[clears throat] Soooo... apparently a conversation ''can'' save Equestria?",
    "That's why we're here. Spike and I are putting together something special for the coronation.",
    "I combined some ancient spells to make a magical scrapbook, and now all we need is some memories to go inside.",
    "Aah! Did we mention we want it to be a surprise?!{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}",
    "I'll do the rest.",
    "Whoa![thud]",
    "Uh... almost?[zip!]",
    "You want ''me'' to be headmare?!",
    "Uh, that's a pretty big responsibility, Twilight.",
    "Then why not put ''him'' in charge?",
    "I'm gonna pretend that made sense. But if you're sure it's what you really want, I promise I won't let you down.",
    "Great. What could possibly go wrong?[galloping]",
    "Come back soon! Please!",
    "Huh?",
    "Discord! What a... heh... nice surprise! This is your first time at our new school, isn't it?",
    "Well, at least you're here now. Um, why ''are'' you here now?",
    "Nope. Twilight picked me for the job. And she left pretty detailed instructions for me to follow.",
    "Whoa-oa!",
    "Not gonna happen. I promised Twilight I'd handle this her way. So thanks, but no thanks.",
    "Don't worry, Spike. Discord and I are old \"save Equestria\" buddies. He'll be fine. Now, what's next on Twilight's list?[door opens]",
    "[sighs] Thanks, Spike. Maybe we ''will'' get through this okay.[doors open][peacocks call][Castle Thunder]<!--That is the official name of the stock sound effect, don't change-->[typewriter clicking]",
    "Discord! What are you doing?!",
    "[gags] We'll take it from here, Discord. Go relax. Have a cup of tea. At home.[door stops]",
    "Which teachers did you hire?[stomp]",
    "[quietly] That's not how Twilight teaches friendship.",
    "You hired a ''tree'' as a teacher?!",
    "W-W-W-Wait! Calm down, everycreature! It's gonna be okay!",
    "Discord!",
    "This is all ''your'' fault!",
    "What I ''need'' is for you to leave!",
    "[groans] Thanks, Spike. Let's just hope he stays gone.",
    "But why? I thought we were friends.",
    "Oh, well, I'm ready for him. I told Twilight I'd run her school right, and I'm gonna keep that promise. No matter what.[nighttime ambience]",
    "Good morning, students! I know there's been a little bit of adjustment since the professors left for their trip. But I've brought in ''new'' new teachers. And now everything should run smoothly. Now it's time for class. And don't forget, this afternoon is the Spell-venger Hunt!",
    "Discord, that's enough! Endangering students crosses the line! I don't know ''why'' you're trying to ruin this school, but it stops now![flash]",
    "This is your last warning.",
    "Well, he's not acting like it!",
    "[gasps, yells][zap!][crackles]",
    "[nervous laughter] Don't worry. I just banished him from school grounds forever. He's fine.",
    "Because he's right about ''one'' thing. I've been doing a terrible job as headmare.",
    "Maybe. But I wonder why me being in charge bothers him so much.[school bell rings]",
    "For this afternoon's Spell-venger Hunt, you'll need to use the artifacts' history to find where they're hidden in the castle. When you spot one, touch it with a magic shield to keep track of your score.",
    "Ready... set... Spell-venger Hunt![gong strikes]",
    "Awww, Ocellus and Smolder found their first artifact! Wait. What's that?",
    "and",
    "Yup, that's definitely Discord. This is not good.",
    "Only his body. Apparently, his ghost can come and go just fine. Let's go. We have to stop this.[lift clanking]",
    "This time, I'm not using magic.",
    "Everycreature, stop!",
    "It's not haunted. It's Discord.[poof!]",
    "Discord, you can't keep messing up the school.",
    "Then I have just one thing to say to you.",
    "I'm sorry.",
    "I had to stop thinking like a headmare and start thinking like a guidance counselor to finally understand. You felt left out.",
    "Nopony ever invited you to the school. And when you offered to help, I didn't listen. I was so worried about doing things Twilight's way, I didn't stop to think about being a good friend. I'd like to apologize for that. And offer you the job of vice headmare.",
    "Next time you want something, just ask for it, all right?",
    "Now, Vice Headmare Discord, if you'll help me get this Spell-venger Hunt back in order.",
    "It was a challenge. Heh. But I think things turned out just the way you'd have handled them.",
    "It's... the ponies from my old village.",
    "Oh. It's only a dream.",
    "With my past, I should never be in charge of anything!",
    "Chrysalis and the changelings are back. They've ponynapped all of the most powerful ponies in Equestria!",
    "...this is Thorax. He's a reformed changeling.",
    "Maybe we should come up with a plan first?",
    "Without magic, I have no idea. But nopony else is coming. So ''some''pony better come up with ''some''thing.[beat]",
    "Anypony? Anything? Hmm. This throne \u2013 if we get into the hive and destroy it, can we get our magic back?",
    "and",
    "Give Discord a break. None of us knew we weren't going to be able to use magic.",
    "If we get separated, it might make sense to have a way to make sure we are who we say we are.",
    "\"Klutzy draconequus\". Works for me.",
    "If Thorax is right, then yes.",
    "I... don't know.",
    "Cut. It. Out! I'm just barely keeping it together, and it would be ''wonderful'' if you two could actually try to help instead of bickering like foals!",
    "Don't ask me! I couldn't even handle giving advice at the Sunset Festival, and I ''had'' magic then! And the three of us are as good as useless! At least Thorax knows where we're going.",
    "But you aren't hungry ''at all'' now?",
    "Is that about the same time your wings changed?",
    "Do you have any of your smoke bombs?",
    "\"Klutzy\"...",
    "Actually, we might. Two of the changelings didn't go with the rest.",
    "[embarrassed laugh][changelings' wings buzzing]",
    "We... go in.",
    "We need some kind of... distraction.",
    "You shouldn't underestimate yourself.[doors closing]",
    "But if we ''do'' manage to destroy Chrysalis' throne, we'll need him. He could take on the entire changeling army by sneezing if he wanted to.",
    "[whispering] You know that's not Discord, right?",
    "Wait, what?! Trixie, you can't! I won't know what to do! We've already lost Discord; I can't lose you too! Without magic, I\u2014",
    "and",
    "[whimpers][zap]",
    "What plan? Why did you do all this?!",
    "What if you didn't have to?",
    "Exactly! Thorax left the hive and made a friend. He ''shared'' love, and now he doesn't ''need'' to feed. You don't have to live your lives starving all the time!",
    "I know what it's like to lead by fear and intimidation! And I know what it's like to want everypony to do what you say! But I was wrong. A real leader doesn't force her subjects to deny who they are! She celebrates what makes them unique and listens when one of them finds a better way!",
    "No! Stop!",
    "Then don't! Sharing love is what made you different to begin with! You should share yours with Chrysalis! Give her all of it![magic blasts]",
    "This is what happens when you give love freely instead of taking it![transformation sounds][kaboom!][music]",
    "We defeated the changelings with no magic at all, they found a new leader, and... they're all kinda... good now.",
    "When Twilight and her friends defeated me, I chose to run away and seek revenge! You don't have to! You can be the leader your subjects deserve.[wind rustling][smack!]",
    "Actually, now that you can snap your claws and send us absolutely anywhere again, I think I have a ''better'' option.",
    "Yeah... I guess after the way I used my magic on all of you, I wasn't sure I was somepony who should even be in charge of a baking contest. I was afraid I might go back to being the pony I used to be. But I realize that sometimes you don't have a choice. You ''have'' to step up. And I ''have'' changed! I can handle it. Whether that means saving Equestria or helping friends out with the Sunset Festival. Speaking of which, I know the Festival's almost over, but I kinda invited a few of my friends to join. Hope that's okay.",
    "Great! Now where's that baking contest? This pony needs a cupcake!",
    "That's good, because there isn't any place for us to hide while you do it, so you're gonna be on your own. The book's all set. When you're ready, just tap the cover with your hoof, and it'll start recording whatever memories are nearby.[door opens]",
    "A-And that's why a savory pie is a far superior\u2014! Oh, hey, Twilight!",
    "Oh! Hello, Spike! I didn't see you there, since we came into the shop separately and not together.",
    "and",
    "Oh! Hello again! It seems that we\u2014 uh, ''I'' forgot to pick up our\u2014 um, ''my'' order.",
    "Oh, that's great! And the book worked okay when you tapped it?",
    "Pinkie, that was great! I think we got everything we needed.[thud]",
    "[snoring]",
    "What...? Oh, no! Spike, we fell asleep! I'm sorry, Pinkie. We didn't get any of the memories you just went through.",
    "Did he, though?![whirring][shing!][crash!]",
    "[blows raspberry][teleportation zap]",
    "No way! She's always needed you guys![whoosh!][zap!]",
    "Ugh!",
    "Sorry, I'm so late. I actually thought I'd missed you\u2014",
    "I was just about to say the same thing. I know maybe it wasn't the coronation you planned, but it's good to see all of you laughing.",
    "Since you're moving away, we thought if you missed any of us or Ponyville, this might help.",
    ", and",
    "Hi, Twilight! Looks like you could use a guidance counselor's help! Hint, hint.",
    "[sadly] Great. Well, I'll just... go dust my office for the seventieth time.",
    "Hmm? [dryly] Yay. Now I'll alphabetize them in reverse order. [sighs] Not much need for a guidance counselor at a school of friendship.",
    "Aah![thud]",
    "How much of that did you hear?! Uh, never mind.[teleportation zap]",
    "[laughs nervously] Welcome! Can I get you a comfort pillow? Security blanket? Empathy cocoa?",
    "Oh! Well, I have plenty of that! Anecdotes, insight, midnight confessions... I'm babbling. [clears throat] Go ahead. I'm listening.",
    "Why would you do that? Uh, sorry. Listening. [sips cocoa]",
    "That's devious. I-I mean, I see. [sips cocoa]",
    "Actually, I think you're doing all right. Sure, that was a really, really bad way to try to help your friends, but what matters is you wanted to. The reason the Cutie Mark Crusaders don't go to this school is because they'd make better teachers than students.",
    "Hmmm...[students chattering][scraping]",
    "Sorry to interrupt, Miss Cheerilee. But can I borrow Apple Bloom, Sweetie Belle, and Scootaloo?[ominous music]",
    "Just the opposite. Cozy Glow, is there something you'd like to say?",
    "We could use some friendship tutors on staff. And I hear you're the best out there.",
    "Welcome! I'm so pleased to have you here.",
    "Forgive my bluntness, but I'm assuming it's ''Princess'' Twilight Sparkle? We don't get many Alicorns around here.",
    "So! How did you hear of our little village?",
    "Well, however you found us, we're happy to have you! We're happy to have anypony who wants to experience ''true friendship'' for the first time.",
    "Oh, indeed. That's what's so unique about our village, you see. Around here, we don't flaunt our special talents because we don't have any special talents to flaunt.",
    "Perhaps it would be easier to understand if I gave you a tour of the village!{{#lstIn Our Town|song}}",
    "We have no judgements here in our village. Each of us was confused once as well, blinded by the false promise of our cutie marks.",
    "Have you considered perhaps that you might have been sent here so ''we'' could help ''you''? After all, nopony has ever come to our village and wanted to leave. Why should you be any different? But that is entirely ''your'' choice. Please enjoy our little corner of Equestria. We're all quite fond of it. No doubt you will be as well. Double Diamond, please help our guests with whatever they might need.",
    "Well, this will certainly provide a boost to our little community. When the rest of Equestria sees that a princess gave up her cutie mark to join us, they'll finally understand what we're trying to accomplish.",
    "I'm delighted you're interested in our cutie mark vault. We hope someday every pony in Equestria will make a pilgrimage here to our little village to have theirs removed too, and our message of [continues under] perfectly equal friendship can finally spread across the land.",
    "Just through here! Behold! Our cutie mark vault!",
    "And here is the Staff of Sameness. It was one of the great Mage Meadowbrook's nine enchanted items. We are incredibly fortunate to have it here. This is the tool that allows us to free ourselves from our marks! I'm curious \u2013 how did the subject of the vault come up?",
    "[gasps] Were they? Well, it seems you inspire all sorts of free thinking, don't you?",
    "Good. Let's just make sure of that, shall we?",
    "Aw. I don't blame you for what you tried to do here today. You've spent your whole lives thinking those marks are a good thing.",
    "Well, now you can spend the rest of your lives here with us! And we'll teach you just how much better life can be ''without'' your cutie marks![To be continued...][credits]{{Transcripts}}[[ptTranscri\u00e7\u00f5es/O Mapa das \"Cutie Marks\", Primeira Parte]]{{Infobox Transcript}}[oven timer ticks]",
    "[grunts]",
    "Oh, my fault! Totally my fault! Are you okay? I should've been watching where I was going, and\u2014 You look really familiar. Have we met before?",
    "I knew it!",
    "No, no, don't tell me. Um...",
    "Yeah. See, I was really hoping you'd tell me while I pretended to remember.",
    "Psst! Do you know a lot about rocks?",
    "Have you ever come across some kind of super-powerful stone that can store the cutie mark magic of... I don't know... an entire village?",
    "[chuckling weakly, sighs] Well, great seeing you again. I gotta run a few errands. [sighs]",
    "You wanna help?",
    "You're messing with me.",
    "[laughs, sighs] So other than rocks, what else are you into?",
    "I like... kites.[beat]",
    "[sighs]",
    "The trick with an S.L.K. is not to make the spars too heavy. But if they're too light, you've got no ballast and then good luck tacking against the A.O.I.! [beat] I really like kites.",
    "Uh, just hanging out\u2014",
    "Um... I feel... like I don't want to talk about feelings?",
    "Oh, I know. But she always calms down. Eventually.",
    "Why do you find rocks so fascinating?",
    "Wow. You can tell that from a line?",
    "[laughs]",
    "They're beautiful and strong, but they don't judge you or make you feel less than in any way. I think I'm starting to like rocks, too.[tapping]",
    "It's hollow?",
    "Wow! Have you ever seen anything like this?",
    "Oh, we won't have to wait for that. There's gotta be a spell that\u2014",
    "Boulder, that was awesome!",
    "More sand than stone, apparently.",
    "Yeah, um, I-I don't know if I can make it.",
    "Oops.",
    "[snoring softly]",
    "[yelps] Kites![thud]",
    "Huh? Oh. If this is about brunch, I-I, uh... You know what? Jalape\u00f1o red velvet omelettes sound gross. I-I just can't.",
    "Oh. I guess Ghastly Gorge really does have the best rocks.",
    "Pinkie Pie, I ''like'' Maud.",
    "Yeah. She's weird!",
    "No, in a good way! She sees the world in a totally different way than anypony I've ever met. She accepts me for who I am. She taught me that a rock is never just a rock, and she could make anything funny. We never had to say it, but we got each other.",
    "I think so, but you kinda sorta... got in the way.",
    "[gasps] You're right, too harsh. Let's go with... You ruined everything all the time?",
    "Mmmmh, that's worse. What I'm trying to say is\u2014",
    "Ta-da... Friendship lesson... learned? [sighs][wind blowing][picking][crumbling]",
    "You're back!",
    "For good?",
    "Heh. No way.",
    "Totally! Where is it?",
    "It's perfect.",
    "What is ''that''?",
    "I'll judge a book by its cover just this once.",

    "Well, ''you'' don't know what it was like to be left behind! And then getting so bitter that you steal the cutie marks from an entire village and then get defeated by Twilight and her friends, so you travel through time to get back at them, but they beat you again and teach you about friendship, but you're so terrified ponies will find out what you did that you can't make any friends![long beat]",

So he asked the neighboring town of, uh, Bovineville to come help them. [giggles] Yeah! Cows! The magical cows helped the goats, everyone survived, and lived happily ever after!",

    "Um... [nervous chuckle] Not quite. Any yak wanna shout out another answer?[beat]",
    "[whines]",
    "Hey, Prince Rutherford. I wanna talk to you about something. Uh, what are you doing?",
    "Okay, yeah. That's what I wanna talk to you about. You know, these yak snow beds are the fluffiest I've ever slept in. They're so comfortable, you forget that it's just a cold block of ice. And the yak snow sandwiches? Mm-mmm! I hate it when food burns your mouth or overwhelms it with flavor!",
    "You know who would really, ''really'' enjoy these snow sandwiches? Twilight Sparkle and the other ponies! Oh, hey! I have an idea! Why don't I go to Ponyville and bring them back here?",
    "Oh! Ponies ''love'' snow sandwiches! And hey, while they're here, you can ask if they'll clear the snow away. Fun, right?",
    "W-W-Wait a minute. You spent the whole winter in a hole?",
    "Okay. First of all, how did you make such a deep hole from stomping? And how did it freeze over so fast? And how could you see your family and friends to wave to them from inside a frozen hole? Even if all that was possible, how did you breathe in there?![slam!]",
    "But the yaks are hungry! And who knows when the snow will melt? I just don't understand why\u2014",
    "Fine! Be stubborn!",
    "[groans] Those yaks are so stubborn! They refuse to ask for help, even though they need it! Well, this official friendship ambassador is gonna take matters into her own hooves! I'll show them![beat]",
    "[sighs] You're right, Gummy. I ''am'' too worked up. Road trip game would officially calm me down. I know! Let's play Twenty Million Questions!

    "Stop! We can't bring the yaks any pony stuff!",

    "How could I possibly ''not'' know? Clearly this dastardly deed was done by the baker who knew their dessert could not measure up to the mastery of the Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness. I guess you feared your \u00e9clairs lacked flair, Gustave![silent film music]",
    "Thus, destroying the cake and the Cakes' chance of winning the National Dessert Competition.",
    "What do you mean, lowly assistant?",
    "Huh... Guess that isn't a totally silly question.",

    "But I was so sure that it was one of the other bitter bakers that destroyed the \"MMMM\". That way, their delicious dessert would reign supreme. I mean, just look at Joe's Donutopia. It's a spectacular city of donutty delight, topped temptingly in sprinklicious sprinkles. And Gustave's \u00e9clairs look incredibly edible, with glistening glaziness. But then there's Mulia Mild's Mousse Moose. [sighs] why, this mouth-wateringly marvelous mousse moose tempts the taste buds with its silky, smooth, yummy-nummy, chocolateyness. So why did this criminal devour the Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness while leaving this trio of tasty treats untouched?[munching sounds][scream]",

    "I most certainly did. It was none other than... the bakers![gasp]",
    "First of all, Gustave has mousse in his moustache! And Joe has \u00e9clair in his hair! And Mulia has sprinkles in her wrinkles!",

    "[scoffs] Yeah. What is taking her so long? [giggles] Just kidding. You guys really need to look behind you once in a while.",
    "Not telling so much as showing. In fact, what you're about to see may shake the very foundations of your perception for all time!",
    "Yes! But wait, there's more![click][squeak!]",
    "It's an invitation to visit the Cheese Sandwich Amusement Factory!",
    "That's ridiculous! They make way more there than just rubber chickens! [giggles]",
    "I am! I can't wait to tour his factory, catch up, have him tell me my life's purpose, swap gag tips\u2014",
    "Uh, catch up? I mean, it has been a while.",
    "Oh, that. Yeah. It's just... All of you have found your thing. You're gonna rule all of Equestria, Rainbow Dash is a Wonderbolt, Fluttershy has her animal sanctuary, Rarity has her boutiques, Applejack has the hat... And the farm! So that's like... two things! I don't even have ''one''. [sighs, chomps] When I first got Cheese's invite, I was a little jealous. It felt like even he was moving on to bigger and better things. And everypony was leaving me behind. But then I realized Cheese Sandwich is a party pony just like me. If he figured out his purpose, he can help me figure out mine.",
    "I know, silly. That's why ''I'm'' going to visit Cheese Sandwich's factory so ''I'' can ask him to help ''me''. [chomps]",
    "I am not! [chomps]{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}[bouncing]",
    "Yup! Anypony with a smile like that is exactly the kind of pony I want helping me![bouncing]",
    "Oh, hey, guys! Pardon me? Just gonna... squeeze by? [straining]",
    "You sure can! I'm here to see Cheese Sandwich!",
    "Aw, that's a shame. To think I came all this way because of this personal invitation from Cheese Sandwich himself.",

    "Oh, [giggles] come on. That's just off the top of my head. You probably get, like, seventeen thousand ideas like that from Cheese every minute.",
    "I think it's a whoopee cushion.",
    "But what if you made the embarrassing sound come from somepony else?!",
    "So... which way is Cheese's office again?",
    "What about Cheese?",
    "Ohhh-ho-ho. What if, instead of slipping, you were sticking? One step on this banana peel, and you can't get it off! [giggles] ''That's'' funny!",
    "Great! Because ''he's'' exactly the pony ''I'' need to see![door opens]",
    "Uh... hello?",
    "Of course I did. Your factory's... big. It really seems like you found your purpose. Which is perfect, since I came here for help.",
    "Well, that's triple-perfect, because... uh, wait. Why do you need ''my'' help?",
    "[gasps]",
    "You lost your laugh? Is that some kind of joke? Because it's not a funny one.",
    "Riiiiight... Why don't we continue this discussion over some delicious canned peanut brittle, hmm? [laughs][sproing]",
    "Wow. You ''did'' lose your laugh. That's horrible!",
    "Wait. So you can tell if a gag is funny is not \u2013 you just can't laugh at it?",
    "How did this happen?",
    "I think I've got two words for you. Knock... knock.",
    "Boo.",
    "Don't cry, because I'm gonna get you your laugh back!",
    "Let's start with something small. Excuse me, Mr. Smirk. But is there something in my... eye?![rattling]",
    "Why, thanks, Sans, ol' pal. Put her there![buzzing]",
    "Oh. Sorry about that. Let me make it up to you. How about some... pie?[splat!]",
    "Come on! Those classic bits put Rainbow Dash's funny bone in a cast for a week!",
    "Hmmm... Maybe we need to start even smaller.",
    "You can't run before you can walk, and you can't laugh before you can smile. And your smiler's all out of whack. Now let's see what we're working with. Give me your biggest, bestest smile!",
    "Almost... [laughing nervously] Maybe I just need to spot you for a rep or two. [straining] Okay! You got this! It's all you! Ready?",
    "Awww...",
    "I'm not giving up on you yet, Cheese. I know there's something somewhere that'll make you laugh. I just have to figure out where to look.",
    "How do you science funny?",
    "I... guess that makes sense. \"Rule of threes\". Hmmm. One, two, three. Yup. That math checks out. Hmmm. At this point, I'm willing to give anything a try.[montage music][awestruck sounds][door closes][clang!][splash!][\"uh-uh\", \"nope\", etc.][squirt][pop-pop-pop]",
    "[groans] I don't understand! We've tried everything! Stand-up, classic gag, physical humor, prop comedy, vaudeville, surrealist alt-scene character pieces \u2013 nothing's worked!",
    "What do you mean?",
    "[gasps]",
    "So that's it? You're all just giving up?",
    "But... Cheese was just as funny as me. I-I can't believe that's all gone.[doors open]",
    "You're not gonna close down, are you? I thought this place was Cheese's life's purpose!",
    "I need to find my life's purpose, but I don't think that's it. I'm a party pony! I need to make ponies happy in real-time!",
    "Guess it's back to the drawing board.",
    "Hold on. What did you just say?",
    "No-no-no-no. Before that.",
    "[groans] That was me!",
    "Yes! That! We've been going about this all wrong! We don't need to make Cheese laugh. ''He'' needs to make ''us'' laugh![zip!][door opens]",
    "Cheese! I figured it out! I know why you can't laugh!",
    "You started this factory because you didn't want to disappoint smiling faces. But in here, you can't see any.",
    "Except you don't ''see'' it. You're a party pony like me. You need to make ponies smile in-person! Here. Just try it.",
    "Really?",
    "Here. Try me. I promise I'll laugh.",
    "Hey! That's what I came here looking for!",
    "Actually, I think I'm good.",
    "...And then I said goodbye, and then I came here! Oh! And then I gathered you all together and started telling you about it. First, I said\u2014",
    "Yup. But I think Sans Smirk's hooves were the perfect ones to leave it in. As much as Cheese was born to wander Equestria and make ponies laugh in-person, Sans was born to run that factory.",
    "Nope! I figured out Cheese and I are pretty much the same. We both need to see ponies laughing to feel fulfilled. And I already do that. My life is purposing itself all over the place!",
    "Thanks. Oh! I almost forgot! I got you all a little something from my trip. Who likes peanut brittle?[boom!][squeak!]",

    "As everypony knows, the Running is a very important tradition, for without it, the autumn leaves of Equestria would ''never'' fall. So get ready, ponies. The Running of the Leaves will begin in ''five minutes''.",
    "Racers! Please take your positions!",
    "Hey, Spike! What's up? Oh wait, it's me! I'm up! [laughs]",

    "Ugh. Those lazy, lazy leaves. But this year, the run is about more than the weather. It's about the race to the finish and the two runners who want to win it Applejack and Rainbow Dash.",
    "Yes, and \"grudge\" rhymes with \"fudge\".",
    "And I like fudge. But if I eat too much fudge I get a pudge and then I can't budge.",
    "Oh, no thanks. I had a big breakfast. Let's check in with our two competitive ponies, Applejack and Rainbow Dash. Having come fast out of the gate, Applejack and Rainbow Dash are evenly matched running neck and neck. But what's this? Applejack is making a move, she's now ahead by a nose. But Rainbow Dash won't let Applejack have it and takes the lead. ''She's'' ahead by half a nose. Or maybe three quarters of a nose. No, about sixty-three point seven percent of a nose... roughly speaking. Applejack sees this move and pushes forth with her strong workhorse legs slinking ahead by three hundred and fifty noses!",
    "What an ''upset''. I thought Applejack had this in the bag.",
    "She's the head of the pack, all right. The pick of the litter! The cat's pajamas! Oh wait, why would Applejack take some poor kitty's PJs? That's not very sporting of her.",
    "Welcome back, Ponyvillians, it's me, Pinkie Pie.",
    "I'm not sure how ketchup is going to help her in this contest. Now, in a hot dog eating contest it can make them doggies nice and slippery, but personally, I prefer mustard. How about you, Spike?",
    "Aaand it looks like Applejack has found ''her''self in quite a pickle as Rainbow overtakes her.",
    "Applejack, what are you doing up here?",
    "I must say, Spike, that this has been the most interesting Running of the Leaves in Equestria history!",
    "But it isn't the running that's been fascinating. It's the ''lack'' of running!",
    "Once again, Rainbow Dash and Applejack are neck and neck, jockeying for position. Applejack inches ahead, now it's Rainbow, it's Applejack, it's Rainbow Dash, it's Applejack...[horn blaring, crowd cheering]",

I was gonna ask my mom, because she's, you know, my ''mom'', but it turned out she didn't want to go, so I started asking around and around and around, and I couldn't think of anypony, and I was about to just go by myself, and I realized, of course! Who loves fancy exciting affairs more than anypony else? ''My sister Maud!''",

    "Uh, Gummy? Could you take over for a bit? Hopefully this'll be quick. I'll just measure the baking powder for you... [squee] ...and when the first layer cools, you can drizzle some of the ganache over it. And don't forget to beat the egg whites for the meringue![cutie mark ringing]",

    "Well, that wasn't very nice.",

    "Pinkie!",
    "Hey! These 'dweebs' are here to help Griffonstone!",
    "Well... we're not really sure! But it involves a map and our cutie marks and a problem, and\u2014",
    "Well if you don't have a king, could you at least tell us where the Idol of Boreas is?",
    "[stifled giggling]",
    "[tearing up] That was the saddest story ever!",
    "No wonder Twilight's book ended with the coronation of King Guto. Who would want to record a history that sad?[thump]",
    "I think Rainbow Dash is right! The map sent us here to fix some sort of problem!",
    "Wait, Rainbow Dash. What about Twilight's advice?",
    "She mentioned finding answers at the library.[thwap]",
    "Hey, Gilda! Word on the street is that Griffonstone has an amazing library chock-full of answers!",
    "Okay, maybe not ''this'' street, but on other streets, your library is the talk of the town.",
    "[gasps] Maybe it's good that Twilight didn't come... [to statue] It's sad what happened to your town, King, but Rainbow Dash can't be right. This can't all be because of a missing hunk of gold. [as King Grover] ''You are right, Pinkie! And you've got amazing hair!'' [normal] Aw, King Grover, you old charmer![statue breaks][bonk!]",
    "[gasps] I know what Griffonstone needs!",
    "A song! I've got a super song about smiling that sure to make even the most grumpy griffon grin! [inhales]",
    "But how do you break into uplifting musical numbers with no singing?",
    "Well if I can't sing, how about a party? If there's one thing these griffons need, it's a good cheer! Where's your party store?[beat]",
    "No party store? Uh, how about cake? Nothing cheers folks up like cake! Where's a bakery?",
    "No ''singing'', no ''party store'', no ''bakery''?! ''What is this place?!''",
    "Well, that just takes the cake. Wait, no! It can't take the cake 'cause there is no cake! Or muffins! Or griffon scones!",
    "I'll buy one! [chomp]",

    "[spits] I can help you with that![wind blowing]",
    "[chewing] Grampa Gruff's recipe is good, but it's missing one important ingredient.",
    "Uh, no. Baking powder. Lucky for you, I never leave home without it! Now just pop those in the oven, and you'll have griffon scones worth their weight in gold!",
    "Aha! I saw that, Gilda! You may act like a gruff, grumbling griffon, but inside you're gracious and great!",
    "You just helped your friend up when she got knocked down.",
    "[poink!] [slide whistle noise] Oh, my gosh, I gotta go find Rainbow Dash!",

    "[in distance] Lemme look![beat]",
    "One rope coming up!",
    "We need help. Don't go anywhere!",

    "Hugging later, climbing ''now''!",
    "Apology accepted.",
    "That's what I was trying to tell you! The map didn't send us here to find the lost Idol of Boreas. It sent us here to replace it with something better!",
    "That's because you don't have friendship! If you can learn to care about each other again, Griffonstone could be a mightier kingdom than it ever was before! And you don't need some golden idol to do that. You just need each other.",
    "Eh, what can I say? That's how I roll. Go on, Gilda! Go make a friend!",

[nervous laugh] Ah, silly me, I can't possibly stay here all night -- with Applejack. [reading] ''Slumber 101 All You've Ever Wanted to Know About Slumber Parties But Were Afraid to Ask.''",
    "Yes, uh, great. [nervous laughter]",
    "Silly! This is called a mud ''mask''. It's to refresh and rejuvenate your complexion.",
    "[sigh] To reduce the puffiness around one's eyes, of course.",
    "Did you hear that, Applejack? You certainly would not want to do anything that would ruin Twilight's very first slumber party, ''would you''?",
    "So do we have an agreement?",
    "Oh! Gross! You know, there's messy and there's just plain rude.",
    "Fortunately, I can get along with anypony, no matter how difficult ''she'' may be.",
    "That's not even a word.",
    "Yay.",
    "So, how are you getting along over there, Applejack?",
    "Never heard of it, but I have a much better one. It's the horrifying story of the messy, inconsiderate ghost who irritated everypony within a hundred miles! Oo-oo!",
    "It is a ghost story, they're ''all'' made up.[screams]",
    "[gasp] [scream]",
    "Then you place one marshmallow on the top of the chocolate and be sure it's centered--that's critical--and then carefully put another perfectly square graham cracker on the top. And done. Ta-da! [laugh]",
    "[sigh] You could at least say excuse me.",
    "I dare Applejack to do something carefully and neatly for a change.",
    "I think the ''truth'' of the matter is that somepony could stand to pay a little more attention to details.",

    "Oh, Pinkie, dear, this is just a business trip for me. I need to scour the city for the most perfect location for my new shop. And while it's lovely how excited you are, there's absolutely ''no'' chance of me getting swept into the\u2013 [gasps] [suddenly excited] energy, the beauty, the ''majesty'' of the greatest city in all of Equestria![doors open]",
    "[sighs] This city's simply a-''ma''-zing! It's just... everything, ever!",
    "Oh, you Pie sisters have just about the sweetest family traditions! Every year, you set aside a special day to spend with each of your sisters?",
    "[hushed] Okay, what's the secret?",
    "You just said 'pssst'.",
    "Maud!",
    "Well, I'll just leave you two to your PSSS''D''. And now, I am off to scout possible locations for my new boutique!",
    "Oh, of course.",
    "[nervously] Only if you let go of my leg and stand up...",
    "Why, Pinkie, that really ''is'' the perfect gift for Maud!",
    "Hmm, and you want to get a pouch for Maud without ruining the surprise... Well, luckily for you, I know exactly what you should do! Why not sight-see on a path that leads right to the pouch store? That way Maud won't get suspicious! I'll come with you to distract Maud, so...",
    "Y-Yes, yes, yes, let's not get ''too'' excited until you actually get a pouch for Maud.",
    "Oh, what a spectacular view! You really can see everything from here!",
    "I-It certainly is\u2013 [grunts] \u2013cozy... but this simply won't do! Working in a space this small would make me lose my mind!",
    "[inhales]",
    "Pinkie, put down that crayon! The Cantering Cook isn't that kind of restaurant!",
    "Oh... A pony could get used to eating at places like this!",
    "[stutters] ...Well, isn't that something! [deliberately] You know what, Pinkie Pie? Uh, maybe you could help me figure out what to order!",
    "[hushed] Okay, remember the plan. I will stay here and distract Maud while you go get a pouch!",
    "[deliberately] Oh, why, thank you for the kind assistance, Pinkie Pie. And now I know exactly what to order.",
    "So, Maud... that Boulder of yours is such an interesting... ahem... character. You must tell me, how did the two of you first meet?",
    "[deadpan] Wow. What a surprisingly suspenseful and compelling story. I completely get what you see in him now. [gasps] Pinkie Pie, you're back! [deliberately] Oh, your hooves must be sparkling clean!",
    "Gar\u00e7on! One super-deluxe two-mile-high hot fudge sundae, stat![thump]",
    "What happened? Did you get a pouch for Maud? Tell me everything!",
    "Oh, not to worry, dear! I'll just have to help you find a new present for Maud. We have plenty of time before your gift exchange at sunset and all of Manehattan to explore. We're bound to find something Maud would like. Maybe even more than a rock pouch!",
    "Maud, I can't help but notice you're staring at that marvelous giraffe. I was just wondering, any chance you could see yourself with it?",
    "Now, Maud, I know you're a big fan of rocks, so get your camera ready, because these are the most spectacular rocks in all of Manehattan! Surely there must be something here that catches your eye.",
    "[whistles] All right. You and me, Maud, you and me. What do you think about... this? Or this? Or this? Or this? Or this? Or this? Or this? This? This? This? This? This? [repeats, accelerating into gibberish]",
    "What is it? You have to tell me! Was it this bike? This lamp? This grappling hook? What do you like?!",
    "Fissure in thhhhhhhe soil...? ''What?!'' But I...! All of this...! And she likes a ''crack''?![pop]",
    "[hushed] That sister of yours is simply impossible to shop for! There's nothing she needs or wants!",
    "...and ochre-flecked velvet lining with reinforced triple-crosshatched seams?",
    "Because I'm looking at one just like it! Maybe if you can catch up with him, you could ask\u2014[zoom]",
    "Probably?",
    "Oh, you're back! [to Maud] Darling, I want to get one more picture of you with that astounding fissure in the sidewalk, and the inspiration just struck me for the perfect shot! Uh, be a dear and go stand behind it. Okay, now just, uh, back up a little bit! Little more! And now just a little... uh... twenty yards more! Perfect! Hold that pose! I think we found your new holiday card! [hushed, to Pinkie] So, how did it go? Tell me, tell me, tell me!",
    "Oh, I am so glad to hear that! She's going to absolutely love it!",
    "\"Yup\"? That's it? You got your sister the greatest PSSS''D'' present in the history of ever, and all you have to say is \"yup\"?",
    "But... you're Pinkie Pie. You're supposed to be all [quickly] \"Oh, I'm so excited I bought the rock pouch! And I know I say excited a lot when I'm actually just ''kind of'' excited, but this time I'm ''really'' excited about how excited I am about being this excited over the rock pouch!\" [normally] And then you fire off your party cannon. Say, where is your cannon? [gasps] Did you lose it? Is your party cannon lost somewhere in the big city?!",
    "I can clearly see that something's bothering you, and I want to help. But I can't help you unless you tell me what the problem is.",
    "''You gave away your cannon?!'' But, but that party cannon is your everything! You absolutely love that cannon! How could you possibly part with something that means so much to you?!",
    "Well, I guess I understand... maybe.",
    "After the day we've had, I'm probably looking forward to the swap part of the Pie Sisters' Surprise Swap Day even more than the two of you! [giggles] And I'm not even a Pie sister! I can't wait one more second to see the wonderful gifts you've gotten each other!",
    "[growls] Just open them already![paper ripping]",
    "You're right, that is impressive. But it's no fissure in the sidewalk.",
    "Oh, I'm so relieved to see that you like the pouch. Especially considering what Pinkie Pie had to give up for it. [gasps] Oh!",
    "I mean... forget I said that! I'm, I-I-I'm glad to see that you like the pouch. You can remember that part. Just forget the second part. You know, the second part where I said that Pinkie Pie had to give something up\u2014 [shrieks] Perhaps I should just stop talking now. Nothing!",
    "Gahhhh...[dirt dragging noises]",
    "[deliberately] Ooh! Wow, look how filthy my hooves are! I really should go wash them!",
    "No, no, stop, stop giving me that look! I can't take it! Nnnnn... [quickly] Pinkie Pie feels bad that the gifts that she always gives you are never as good as the ones that you give her!",
    "That's why she was willing to give up the party cannon for the pouch!",
    "Pinkie Pie! You might want to come over here for a second!",
    "[inhales] She broke me.",
    "That's amazing! How did you know where he'd be?",
    "Ooh, I've never seen her like this! Look at the fire in her eyes! You'd better do what she says!",
    "Oh! Did she just clench her jaw?! I think she clenched her jaw!",
    "Oh, no! When she clenches her jaw... you know what that means?!",
    "Trust me, you do ''not'' want to know!",
    "I know, but there is one more sight you two simply must see before we leave.",
    "Voila! Welcome to the future home of \"Rarity For You\"! What do you think of the place? Is this the right location? Did I pick a good spot?",
    "Wait. PSSS-D-W-R? What's that?",
    "Oh! Ohhh! Why, that's the sweetest... Oh, no. Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no. I know how good you two are at giving gifts! I'm going to have to get you both something amazing, and I only have a year to do it!",
    "[sighs] Why, thank you, Pinkie.",
    "Oh, that's not mine. Yes, I ''used'' to overpack a tad, but now it's just the essentials for me. I'm a simple filly.",
    "Applejack, darling, anything in that wagon for mane maintenance?",
    "Ugh, an entire wagon and no anti-frizz? Darling, you're not even prepared.",

    "It's not like Fluttershy to disappear like this.",

    "Really? I can't believe you've never told us that story before.",
    "[to Mean Applejack] I'm going to make sure that she doesn't break a hoof out there, and then you and I are going to have a serious talk!",

    "and",
    "W-What in Equestria's going on here?",

    "I'm sure they're just taking the necessary precautions. Royal weddings do bring out the strangest ponies.",

    "Your highness! Let me just start by saying what an honor it is to play a role in such a momentous occasion. [laughs nervously]",
    "[stammers] Yes, of course. Um, I've been working on it ever since I was given the assignment, and I think you'll be pleased with the results! Mmm!",
    "Oh, yes, of course.",
    "Twilight, whatever are you talking about? Cadance is an absolute gem!",
    "Well, of course she is! Why shouldn't she expect the very best on her wedding day?",
    "The princess is about to get married. I'm sure any negative behavior she might be displaying is simply the result of nerves.[thump]",
    "Seeing as we've been working so hard and everything.",
    "Told you she was an absolute gem!",
    "Hmm. I'll see what I can do.",
    "And I am just the pony to help!",
    "I am going to ignore that comment out of my desire to help you.",
    "Get ready, Rainbow Dash, for I am going to take you on an historical adventure in fashion! I am now modeling the rather unattractive, and frankly itchy, original Wonderbolts flying costume. Fortunately, thanks to the vision of Flair d'Mare, the Wonderbolts ''ensemble'' became more streamlined in a wonderfully breathable fabric. Of course, there were fashion hits... and misses. Just look at those dreadful bell-bottoms. What ''were'' ponies thinking?",

Perhaps there'll be some social events that we can attend! [gasps] I'll have to pack extra outfits! ''What will I wear?!''",

    "That's it!",
    "The flow ''has'' led us here! ''This'' is our mission! [to Saffron and Coriander] We are going to get you a three-hoof rating and save your restaurant! I can get Zesty Gourmand here!",
    "Just leave it to us!",
    "[singsong] I've done it!",
    "It took all of my charm and cajoling, but I was able to convince Zesty Gourmand to come and try the food!",
    "Ah, yes. Well, um, there is a bit of a challenge. The only time she could make herself available is tonight.",
    "Zesty rates a restaurant on cuisine, decor, ''and'' presentation, and she has very specific tastes. If she's coming tonight, there ''is'' quite a bit of work that needs to get done.",
    "Oh, a tweak here, a tuck there, some slight modifications to the menu. [laughs nervously] We just need the place to feel more cosmopolitan.",
    "Why don't I stay behind with Coriander to get the restaurant ready for Zesty's arrival? You and Saffron can try and drum up some business.",
    "Coriander, I understand your trepidation. But I promise you, we will get those hooves by making this place feel just like all of the other restaurants on Restaurant Row![door shuts]",

    "Ohhhh, yes, they will. Pinkie, we ''are'' the perfect team for this! We were just doing the wrong jobs! ''I'' will go out and bring the crowd! You stay here and make sure this place is every bit as unique and rustic as it was the moment we walked in!",

    "No, we can't, and neither can you! Nopony has the right to tell these ponies what to think! Zesty, you have very... specific...",
    "Yes, and very strange opinions about food, and that's your right. But just because you like your food a certain way, there is no reason to tell these ponies that they need to do the same!",
    "Zesty, are you sure you wouldn't like to try the food? Ignoring a unique and fresh establishment such as this could do serious damage to your social standing.",
    "I heard that! [giggles] I've gotten much better at \"roughing it\", haven't I?",
    "I know what you're thinking. But I promise, I only brought the essentials.",
    "Of course. What is life if you can't make it beautiful?[bushes rustling]",
    "Mm, that's not entirely true. We have each other.",
    "Why don't we see if it's safe to head back to camp?",
    "There, there, Sweetie Belle. Not to worry.",
    "Oh, no-no-no-no, no, not true. There's beauty in everything. Even these blah rocks aren't really ''blah''. If you look closely, you can see flecks of gold in them. And the way the firelight dances on the cave wall, shadow and light? Ooh, it's so gorgeous! Sweetie Belle, have I ever told you about ''my'' favorite legend?",
    "Her name... was Mistmane.",
    "Yeeees, but did you know she used to be the most beautiful unicorn in all the land?",
    "Well, Mistmane was a very promising young sorceress.[Asian-style music]",
    "[narrating] She was as talented as she was beautiful and kind. Everypony loved her and missed her when she was sent to the finest magic school.",
    "[narrating] While she was gone, she was delighted to find out that her best friend, Sable Spirit, was crowned empress. She couldn't wait to return home once she finished her studies.",
    "[narrating] But once she arrived, she was ''devastated'' by what she saw.",
    "[narrating] But there was no denying what was in front of her.",
    "[narrating] Sable Spirit took everything that was beautiful away from anypony else! And Mistmane was sure there had to be some explanation.",
    "So did Mistmane. She went to confront her friend.",
    "[narrating] Everypony thought Sable Spirit was defeated, and that was that. But Mistmane knew there was more she could do to help.",
    "[narrating] Beauty isn't everything. But Mistmane knew that it does have the power to make ponies smile.[magic noises]",
    "[narrating] She made a huge sacrifice to bring that smile back to her friends' and family's faces... including Sable Spirit's.",
    "[narrating] Sable Spirit was so touched that she vowed to be more like her friend in the ways that mattered. From then on, she ruled with kindness and compassion.[ponies cheering]",
    "[narrating] Even though she gave away her physical beauty, she dedicated her life to spreading beauty all over Equestria. Any time you go out of your way to brighten somepony's day by doing something like giving them flowers, you're following in the hoofsteps of Mistmane.",

    "Okay, on three. One, two\u2014",
    "Well, almost.[snapping]",

    "Ooh! Oh, terribly sorry, Yona. All these dresses I'm sewing for the dance have me completely frazzled.",
    "[yelps][door opens]",
    "Oh. [laughs] Well, not interrupting exactly. More like blocking the flow\u2014 uh, stopping me from what I'm doing\u2014 so, yes, interrupting! [nervous laugh] Now, what can I do for you, Yona?",
    "Yona could\u2014 I mean, you could. But the Fetlock Fete or whatever Twilight is calling it \u2013 it's all about a tradition. There's a certain way to do everything at the dance.",
    "Well, uh, y-y-yes, if that's what you really want.",
    "In that case, at an elegant affair like a pony dance, one must converse in a sophisticated fashion. Talking with Brussels sprouts in your mouth helps you to learn to [elocuting] ar-ti-cu-late. [normally] Take a mouthful, and repeat after me.",

    "[gasps] I almost forgot! The most important part of the ball!",
    "Oh, not that, darling. The dancing! And I know precisely who can help!",

    "Oh, my!",
    "\"Some\". Ha! Indeed. And we only have a few more days.",
    "Uh, I already told Yona a little bit about that tradition. She's even brought her own lucky... bucket.",
    "Yona, if someone at the party tells you they're thirsty, you say...",
    "By Celestia, I think she's got it!",
    "Yona! You look absolutely scrumptious, darling. [kissing] Uh, why don't I get that for you?",

    "We never meant to try to turn you into something you're not.",
    "Your actions tonight exemplify the true meaning of friendship.",
    "It would be an honor.",
    "Well, that's just it, darling. Princess Cadance and Shining Armor's baby is due any day, and we're still not sure. The Crystal Empire was gone for a thousand years. A lot of their customs are a bit murky.",
    "[stifled giggle]",
    "Ooh!",
    "''And'' a fetching blanket to keep you warm.",
    "But... But... But I thought Alicorn wings had to be earned by accomplishing some great, princess-worthy deed!",
    "I can't imagine cancelling such a beautiful and important ceremony over something so potentially adorable!",
    "That is, if you can stay awake long enough to tell us ''how''.",
    "Now, I know choosing the crystal of purity is a very important decision. So I have gone through the trouble of arranging them in order from incredibly pure to outrageously pure.",
    "Oh, well, to the untrained eye, perhaps. What do you think, Shining Armor?",

    "She's dazzling!",

    "Oh, well, don't mind us, Rainbow Dash.",
    "Uh, on second thought\u2014",
    "Huh! Hasn't ''anypony'' heard of beauty sleep?",
    "Pardon?",
    "It must be gratifying to have your idol writing to ''you'' about the friendship lessons ''he's'' learning.",
    "Ooh! The sewing machines I ordered for my class!",
    "These machines were costly, but I am quite certain the friendship lessons I can teach my students with them will be invaluable.",
    "Oh, don't worry, darling. I'll think of something. And I didn't use the school funds to buy these. I made the purchase entirely with my own bits.",

    "We know what it means. But who would accredit this place?",
    "Well, she did write the book on it.",
    "[gasp]",
    "Uh-oh.",
    "Oh, please. I think I know a disguise when I see one. Take off that ridiculous beard... ''Flam!''[stretching sound]",

    "Perfect! Now, how do we start our investigation?",
    "Hey, Eyepatch! Where's your eye patch? [gasps] Was your cover blown?",
    "Were we wearing our eye patch?",
    "But-But-But that's ridiculous!",
    "Twilight, you are not the kind of pony to let your emotions cloud your judgment. If you think Flim and Flam are up to no good, you can't give up, even if their lessons really are impressive.",
    "Which reminds me. Can you get a message to Spike? I want to return those sewing machines. I need the bits if I'm going to keep advancing here. Tuition's free, but the worksheets sure aren't. [laughs]",
    "Well, they have to cover expenses, and Flam insists that everything extra goes to improving the school and\u2014[beat]",

    "I still don't understand how Flim and Flam could have gotten a copy of your book.[door opens]",

    "[sigh] To think my dresses could soon be displayed on the most glamorous shopping thoroughfare of the most glamorous city in Equestria! Oh, it would be my dream come true!",
    "Hm, nothing I can think of. The dresses are all completely finished, all made from a fabulous new fabric I've been developing for months. Stretchy, but not clingy. Shimmery, but not showy.",
    "There's nothing left for me to do but check in at the runway with my dresses by two this afternoon.",
    "Oh, my ribbons and threads. And the runway ballroom is all the way across town! If I don't get there, I'm disqualified! ''Taaaaxiii!''",

    "Me too, but everything just seems to keep working out!",
    "Oh, yes, of course, of course! I\u2013 I thought you looked familiar, but I couldn't place it. You haven't been back in years!",

    "Oh, why, yes. It's stretchy, but not clingy. Shimmery\u2014",
    "You ''stole'' my fabric!",

    "Spike? Hello?{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}[gem clinking]",

    "Ideally you catch the gems, dear. And for a trip to the post office of all places?[gem clinking]",
    "Maybe you should move closer? And why would Spike need to go to the post office at all? He sends mail by breathing! Breathing, darling! Breath mail![gems clinking]",
    "Honestly, Applejack, if you're going to fill in, you could make an attempt to hold the basket the way Spike would.",

    "Well, certainly. But I think I'd remember if we had an argument.",
    "Well, if I didn't realize what I did, how would I know what I have done when I did it? [brays] I wonder if that's it. It certainly would explain his behavior. I must apologize!",

    "Darling, I don't see why that matters.[clattering][gems clinking][thud][ka-chunk!][deep boom][music playing]",
    "[overdramatically] And that is why I simply cannot bear the thought of having hurt you! And even though I don't know what it is that I did, I want you to know that it doesn't matter! Because I am prepared to do anything to make it right! [sobs] And scene.[ka-chunk!]",
    "Oh, sorry, dear. Here.",

    "I don't understand. You two know each other?",
    "[forced laugh] Yes... Now I understand why you didn't come to the gem cave. Having a friend in town is a rare treat. Well, since you're busy today, maybe we can do something tomorrow. Fabric shopping? I know how you love to pick out the colors.",

    "They were! Honestly, it took everything I had to convince him to spend any time with me at all! But between crystal gem crevasses, Power Pony conventions, and a marathon game of ''O&O'', I managed to get some time in.",
    "What?! Pfft! I most certainly did not![beat]",
    "Well, I... suppose I may have monopolized him a teeny bit. [sighs] I'd just grown so used to having Spikey-Wikey around, I wasn't prepared for how much I'd miss him when he wasn't.",

    "I wish I didn't need to, but the more time you two spent together, the more I missed my time with Spike, and the more I used every means at my disposal to get it back. I am truly sorry.",

    "Oh, try not to worry, Applejack. The map picked us for a reason. Although how we're supposed to uncover that reason, I haven't a clue.

The contact on the flyer is Coco Pommel!",
    "Don't you see?! This ''must'' be why the map called us here! Oh, and you were so worried!",
    "Applejack and I were specifically summoned here to be of service, and you, my dear friend, are in need of help. It's no coincidence, darling. It's fate! [drinks]",
    "It sounds lovely, darling.",
    "Say no more! You finish up your work, and by this time tomorrow, you'll be up to your mane in ponies who want to lend a hoof. Applejack and I will make sure of it!",
    "So you see, the Method Mares are only available on this one day, and we need all the help we can get with preparation.",
    "[clearing throat] Well? What do you think?",
    "Oh, not at all, darling. It's quite lovely.",
    "Well, I could help you with the costumes.",
    "You see, dear? We went out looking for volunteers when all the help you need is right here.",
    "The map wouldn't have chosen just Applejack and me if it was more than we could handle. Everything is going to be just fine!",
    "Perhaps I spoke too soon...",
    "Don't worry, we've still got plenty of time. Everything's going to be\u2014",
    "[hushed] I don't understand. The map summoned us here to solve a friendship problem. We've clearly found it, but why did it send the two of ''us''? Why not Twilight? I'm sure she could have used her magic to transform this park in an instant!",

    "[muffled] Then what are you suggesting\u2014 [ptoo] Then what are you suggesting?",

    "and",
    "[gasps] I understand now! It all makes perfect sense!",
    "I know why the map called you here.",
    "If Twilight had used her magic to fix the park, it wouldn't have fixed the real problem, which is that these Manehattan ponies didn't think they had time to do something for their community! But by building that stage and making sure the play went on, you showed them that just by doing something small, you can make a big difference!",
    "Seems you have more in common with the Manehattan ponies than you thought!",
    "Oh, absolutely, my dear. Just as soon as I stop that pony in the shop over there from purchasing that dreadfully hideous scarf! ''Stop!'' You're making a terrible mistake!",
    "Uh, not quite. I still feel it needs a certain ''je ne sais quoi''. Perhaps it needs... appliqu\u00e9s.",
    "Or sequins.",
    "Sweetie Belle, I adore having you help me, truly I do, but...",
    "This is without a doubt my most prestigious order ever. After all, Sapphire Shores is ''the'' pony of pop, and her Equestria-wide tour launches in Canterlot next week! Which means she must have these outfits by day after tomorrow at the latest!",

    "My, you've been so much help to me. How could I possibly say no? When do you need them?",
    "But, Sweetie Belle, darling! I, I'm behind as it is!",
    "I suppose... if I got a few more ponies to help me, then maybe...",
    "Oh, I'm here, I'm here!",
    "Oh, I beg your pardon for cutting it so close, but I made some improvements to your original design, and I had a terrible time with these froofy sleeves. It is for the first play you ever wrote, after all, so I made quite certain it came out just so.",
    "Indeed. This marvelous extravagance is the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of the entire wardrobe! But alas, without this key hidden stitch, it's just a... I'm trying to think of a nicer way to say 'big bummer'. [sighs] Now perhaps we can all at last take a moment to relax![door opens and closes]",

    "Oh, no-no-no. All of these things were Sweetie Belle's idea. I just assisted with the execution.",
    "Should I hem the cloaks now or wait until I'm there? I could hem them now, but I might have to redo them...",
    "But if I wait until I'm in Canterlot to hem them, Sapphire Shores might not get the best first impression...",
    "Ooh... Sapphire Shores is such a big star and such a stickler for details. What if everything's not perfect enough?",
    "Oh, buck up, Rarity, stop this foolishness. You've done your best and left nothing to chance! All that's needed now is a good night's rest.[click]",

    "Yes, of course we are, darling. In fact, ''we'' just finished. ''Voila!'' I know. You're speechless. Well, if that isn't ''big'' and ''bold'', I don't know what is! Isn't it wonderful? [humming to self]",

Nopony loses hair in a chunk. And look at the ends. It's a straight line! They were clearly cut with shears, which means somepony planted it! Then when we were examining Spitfire's room, I smelled something on the envelope. ''Juniper Phoenix'', Wind Rider's cologne of choice! Then, in the castle hallway, I noticed some of the damask curtains fell out of their velvet rope-holder, indicating that somepony had been hiding behind them! Perhaps ''after'' they dropped off the fake letter?",

A cake that was ordered by a girl pony with a raspy voice! Whoever ordered the cake got a chocolate stain on her ivory scarf, and I couldn't help but notice that Wind Rider's scarf is tied in a tight Windsor knot instead of its usual loose slipknot! And why is that? Is it to hide ''the chocolate stain''?![Wonderbolts gasping]",
    "Just admit it \u2013 you're as guilty of framing Rainbow Dash as you are of ruining that ivory scarf!",
    "No. It was because he was afraid that you would break his long-distance Wonderbolt record! I heard him when Spitfire said you were close to breaking his record. He said, and I quote, 'Heh-heh'. That's the polite but disingenuous laugh you make when you want to seem happy but really you're not.",

    "[sobs, calmer] Mm, point taken. [excitedly] I am going to visit my sister!",
    "We can spend the whole day together! And we can do all her favorite things!",
    "Oh, Sassy, thank you!",
    "I'm going! I'm going! Hang on, sis! I'm coming!",
    "[singsongy] Guess who's here to spend the whole day with her little sister?!",
    "Mmmm!",
    "[to Zipporwhill] Oh! Heh-heh. So sorry, dear. You're tiny. I didn't even see you there! Tend to get carried away with my entrances! Ta-da! [laughs]",
    "I am here to spend the day with you! I'm so excited, I could practically faint! You don't happen to have a fainting couch in here, do you?",
    "Oh, pfft, of course not. It's a treehouse! That would be ''tr\u00e8s gauche''!",
    "Oh.",
    "\"Client\"? Oh, that is so adorable!",
    "[sniffs] Ooh! You have mints to offer your \"clients\". [giggles] How.. professional. [giggles]",
    "Oh, my! Look at this wall of satisfied customers! [gasps] You girls really have come a long way.",
    "Come on, come on! You'll never guess what I have planned! [squeals][foals and Rarity giggling]",
    "Ooh! So fun!",
    "[giggles] It's just I know how much you love these puppet shows.",
    "Oh, it's just like old times! You, me, greasy popcorn. It's like no time has passed at all.",
    "Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! It's your favorite part![music and silly sound effects][foals and Rarity giggling]",
    "Banana peels are so very, very slippery! [laughs] It's funny because it's true! [laughs]",
    "What's the matter, darling?",
    "What?! Since when?",
    "Okay. We're here! Ta-da! [laughs, clears throat] Aren't you excited to be back here again? Do I know my baby sister, or do I know my baby sister?",
    "Oh, pfft! Stop being so silly! You know this is your favorite ice cream shop!",
    "And I convinced the original owner to come out of retirement to make you your all-time favorite dessert! [giggles, claps twice][tray drops]",
    "Well, go ahead. I know you're dying to dig in.",
    "Well?",
    "[gasps] We can get another sundae! Chocolate with rainbow sprinkles, perhaps?",
    "A salad? When did you get so practical?",
    "[gasps] One more Filly Clown Surprise, please![thump]",
    "I know you must be bored, darling. This is a very long line for one of Twisty Pop's balloons.",
    "But just be patient. We'll get you your favorite balloon bouquet, and it'll all be worth it.",
    "Well, I guess duty calls, and-and you, you have that now...",
    "Oh nothing, nothing. Go on.",
    "Sweetie Belle, hurry! He's making it!",
    "[gasps] I know just what to do with this![fashion music]",
    "And pose![camera clicks]",
    "And pose![camera clicks]",
    "Love the camera![camera clicks]",
    "Hate the camera.[camera clicks]",
    "Love it again![camera clicks]",
    "Sweetie Belle, you did \"hate the camera\" for all these shots! [sighs] Let's do it again.",
    "[gasps]",
    "W-What do you mean, no?",
    "Sweetie Belle, what is it? You've been acting weird all day. You used to love doing these things with me.",
    "But it ''is'' you! You love puppet shows and dressing up and taking silly photos and tiny little clown-shaped ice creams!",
    "[whimpering]",
    "[sobbing] I can't believe Sweetie Belle talked to me like that. [indignant] And after everything I did to set up a whole day of doing ''her'' favorite things! I mean, accusing me of not knowing her?! I know her better than anypony! Um, thank you, Twisty, but the hard truth is, my sister is being unappreciative right now! And I'm going to go and give her a piece of my mind![balloon deflating]",
    "Aha! There she is! [gasps] Oh, dear. Really should have changed. [huffs] No matter! I'm going to give her ''quite'' the talking to! ...Right after she's done with her conversation. Anger is no excuse for poor manners, after all.",
    "I know so!",
    "Oh, Sweetie Belle. I heard what you said, and you are ''so'' right.",
    "Yes, but about us, too. The truth is, I know you're not a little filly anymore. But it's just... the last time we did all of those things together, I... I didn't realize it was gonna be the ''last'' last time. I loved doing those things with you. It's hard for me to let that go.",
    "Sweetie Belle, I'm so very proud of the pony you've grown into.",
    "I, uh, have a little bit of time before I have to head back to Canterlot. Could we spend it together? What would a grown pony like you want to do?",
    "and",
    "Heh, I didn't realize your idea would be such a delicious one! [giggles] I don't know how I'm going to finish this.",
    "[giggles]",
    "[groaning]",
    "The poor thing looks so sad! Just what are we doing to do?",
    "Uh, how can I say this tactfully...? You've lost your sparkle, Rainbow Dash.",
    "Whatever did you do that for?!",
    "[starts crying] I can't bear to see Fluttershy cry!",
    "[crying hysterically]",
    "And I'll design him a very special suit just for the occasion, whichever one it ends up being.",
    "Goodbye, Tank.",
    "No, no, no, oh! Goodness no.",
    "Just a moment, please! I'm 'in the zone', as it were. Oh, yes! Sparkle always does the trick, does it not? Why, Rarity, you are a talent. Now, um, how can I help yo\u2014 [yelp] Oh my stars, darling! Whatever happened to your coiffure?!",
    "Out of ''my'' hair? What about ''your'' hair?!",
    "No, no, uh-uh. Too green. Too yellow. Too poofy. Not poofy enough. Too frilly. Too... shiny. Now go on, my dear. You were telling me where you're from.",
    "Huh?[crash]",
    "''Canterlot''?! Oh, I am so envious! The glamour, the sophistication! I have always dreamed of living there! I can't wait to hear all about it! We are gonna be the best of friends, you and I... ''Emeralds''?! What ''was'' I thinking? Let me get you some rubies!",
    "Huh?[ponies chattering quietly and nervously in the background]",
    "She's ''gone''![ponies gasping]",
    "Oh, thank you so much for helping me with these flyers, Spike. I'm so lucky you just happened to be walking past the boutique. [chuckles]",
    "No. [chuckling] It's a call for submissions. Fashion contest I'm organizing. A showcase for aspiring young designers.",
    "Thank you. I remember how difficult it was to break into the fashion industry when I was starting out. That's why the winner of the contest will get to debut their line in the Carousel Boutique!",
    "I've also managed to get esteemed fashion critic Hoity Toity and iconic fashion photographer Photo Finish to come to Ponyville and judge the show. ''And''... [squealing] Wait until you hear who else will be a judge.",
    "No! [chuckling] The third judge for the Carousel Boutique's ''Couture du Future'' Fashion Contest is none other than... Applejack!",
    "...What?{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}",
    "You already said that, darling.",
    "I admit, Applejack ''is'' an unorthodox choice. But that is precisely what makes her an inspired choice!",
    "Hoity Toity has expertise in fabric and stitchwork. Photo Finish has an artistic eye for shapes and colors. But sometimes, we designers forget about practicality. That's where you come in.",
    "Which tells me you're a pony who knows what she likes. Besides, a judge must be honest, and you're the most honest pony there is. Ask any pony \u2013 they'll tell you.",
    "See? So what do you say?",
    "I do understand your hesitation. But before you say no, sleep on it?",
    "[squeals] I just knew you'd come around!",
    "[gasps] It's wonderful to see you! Mwah! Mwah! Mwah!",
    "Thank you both so much for doing this. Mwah! Mwah! Mwah!",
    "Miss Pommel is showing? I thought she was still making costumes.",
    "Oh, my, they're absolutely stunning!",
    "Oh, uh, this is Applejack. Another one of the judges.",
    "[nervous chuckling] So funny... Ahem.",
    "Oh, don't worry about it, darling. Uh, it happens all the time. Besides, that dress ''did'' look a bit like a disco ball. Although, Miss Pommel is making the point that, no matter what we wear, it is a costume of some kind or another.",
    "And... that's okay. Let's go meet the designers and help them get ready for the show!",
    "Designers, welcome! Today you will work on your designs, and we judges will offer our guidance and advice as you prepare for tomorrow's big show.",
    "Lily Lace, tell us about your inspiration.",
    "Next up, meet Starstreak.",
    "Applejack, you've been rather quiet. What do you think?",
    "Ah, well, that's why you're here. Fashion needs a healthy dose of practicality now and then.[hammering][rip]",
    "Okay, yes, not a very practical choice. Fashionable, but not practical.",
    "But of course, no look is complete without mane and makeup!",
    "You know what? Uh, I think we've given the designers enough guidance for today. Let's, uh, let them finish their work.",
    "[chuckling nervously, sighs][acoustic guitar chord]",
    "Yes, of course... Some of her thoughts are tough to swallow, but hopefully her candor will help the designers achieve the best designs possible.",
    "Sure... Hmm.[hard rock solo]",
    "[sighs] Much better.",
    "[inhale, exhale] I can meet my goals. Today is a fresh start. Good morning, everypony! Time for final adjustments before the show!",
    ",",
    "Is everything okay?",
    "Ooh! Both good choices.",
    "You don't mean that!",
    "No! Please! Come back!",
    "[sobbing]",
    "''Stop everything!'' There is no show! Take it all down!",
    "No! It is the opposite of okay! The judges have quit! The designers have dropped out! The show is cancelled! All my good intentions squashed! [sobbing] And it's all Applejack's fault!",
    "Of course! But you said fashion is ridiculous!",
    "Oh\u2014! [scoffs] Come with me![knock, knock!][door opens]",
    "Hello, Strawberry Sunrise. This is Applejack. I was wondering if you could tell her how you feel about apples.",
    "Applejack, why are you so angry? It's just Strawberry's honest opinion. What's wrong with that?",
    "Mm-hmm. Doesn't feel so good, does it?",
    "I appreciate that, Applejack. That means a lot. I just wish you'd realized it before you ruined the fashion show.",
    "B-B-But how?! They were all leaving. This was all coming down.",
    "Ohhhhh! Thank you, Applejack.",
    "First up, Lily Lace![camera clicking]",
    "Starstreak![camera clicking]",
    "Inky Rose![camera clicking]",
    "And now, it's time to vote. I am drawn to the beauty and drama of fashion, and nopony does drama better than Lily Lace, so I vote for her.",
    "Well, it all comes down to you, Applejack.",
    "Well, Applejack?",
    "Lily Lace's clothes go here, Inky Rose's will go there, and Starstreak's there.",
    "And I agree. I told you your perspective would be beneficial.",
    "Oh, that? No! I totally messed that one up! It's ghastly! Horrid! Absolutely terrible!",
    "Pffft!",
    "and",
    "When you're right, you're right!",
    "Ooh, I'm going to start with a facial, and then get my hooves done, and\u2014",
    "Isn't it called \"Manehattan Escapes\" because it's a deluxe spa where you can escape all of your troubles?",
    "[sighs]",
    "Yes, yes, woo-hoo. [clears throat] But just so we know, exactly how long will we be locked in here?",
    "Ooh! Plum or boysenberry?",
    "Yes, but one's a lovely purple and one's... well, icky.",
    "Almost there.",
    "We certainly had a good time, but I ''really'' was looking forward to a spa day, and the Ponyville spa's still open. Anyone?",
    "[gasps] Something just dreadful must have happened to Applejack to make her not return!",
    "Oh, Applejack, thank heavens!",
    "Yes, why are you here?[toilet flushes]",
    "And you are?",
    "Well, uh, you made working on a cherry orchard sound... so delightful.",
    "And how did you meet Miss Jubilee?",
    "Is it because you were insulted when I insulted your hair?",
    "Yes. Desperate times do call for desperate measures.",
    "That was rude!",
    "What? Pinkie\u2013 [screams][crunch]",
    "[coughs][railway crossing bells]",
    "When I get back, you're gonna get it, Rainbow Dash! [grumbles]",
    "Well, that goes without saying, darling. After all, Rainbow Dash is the guest of honor at the Rainbow Festival.[whoosh!]",
    "How dare you! I brought the itsy-est valise!",
    "Did somepony mention something about a spa in...\u00a0where is it we're going again?",
    "Oh, I accept that challenge. I have so many whims.",
    "An award for what, exactly?",
    "I can't see ''anything!'' Oh.",
    "[panicked] And we're headed right for it!",
    "''I don't think that working!''",
    "We've arrived, and there's nopony here to greet us?",
    "Uh, yes, please. Could you direct us to the Hope Hollow Luxury Resort?",
    "and",
    "''The'' room?",
    "[gasping dramatically] How rustic and charming.",
    "Other than that she just called this place \"the Royal Suite\"?",
    "Probably from all the dust up here. [blows, coughs]",
    "But definitely in the top three... or would that be the ''bottom'' three?[ponies murmuring]",
    "No. I think they're staring because we're the only part of this town that isn't... gray.",
    "Look around. All the colors here are ''gone!''",
    "And the way they're gawking at us, it appears they think ''we're'' the odd ones.",
    "At the \"Luxury Hotel\".",
    "Ah! Ugh.",
    "''None'' of these things are as pictured in your brochure.",
    "We should just leave this very moment!",
    "Hmmm, an overall stylistic look to unify the sentiment of the celebration. That's what this festival needs.",
    "Yes, darling, yes, yes, but more complex, more thematic, something like\u2014 Ooh! something like that! ''Formidable!''",
    "[humming] Hmm? That's one of ''my'' designs! Hello?",
    "Uh, it's just \"Rarity\". Uh, and I-I couldn't help but notice that you've got\u2014",
    "Well, thank you\u2014",
    "Yes, about that. The\u2014 the hat, the\u2014 the boa, the scarf, the\u2014",
    "Very charming.",
    "I do hope you don't mind my asking. But with all this talent, why don't you simply display your ''own'' work instead of adding to others?",
    "Hmph, ''au contraire''. Take this shawl. Hoof-dyed, nicely woven, a piece of art by itself. Imagine if you could work in color.",
    "Like a rainbow. How would you like to work with me as the official assistant designer of the Rainbow Festival?",
    "Darling, if we have anything to do with it, not only will there be a festival, it will be the most stylish anypony in this town has ever seen! Now let's get started![magic sounds][music][doors opening]",
    "You're all here! Wonderful! You can help us set up our cart. Kerfuffle's official Rainbow Festival accessories.",
    "Well, of course not, silly. The town doesn't have any color, remember?",
    "And look at my purple kerchief. Isn't it divine?",
    "Something wonderful!",
    "Over here, darlings! Just look what Kerfuffle has come up with!",
    "Oh, not more karaoke, darling.",
    "[shrieks] Please! You have to help us!",
    "The castle isn't open for viewings today. The tapestries all need changing. Again.",
    "I don't socialize with ''dragons''. I don't know anypony who would.",
    "I don't know how you know my name, but I am far too busy to entertain some tourist's ridiculous fantasies.",
    "What in Equestria was that?!",
    "Oh, Opalescence. Can't you just picture it? ''Moi'', stepping out in a stunning new gown at the Grand Galloping Gala in Canterlot!",
    "Why, yes! I did make it myself. Thank you so much for asking.",
    "Oh, Opal, of course you can help me. Thank you.",
    "What's that? You want to help me more? Oh, aren't you the sweetest thing?",
    "Careful now. Don't move. This shouldn't take long at all.",
    "Is there something I can help you with?",
    "[gasps] Oh, no, no, no! You can't wear this... old thing. You need a glamorous new outfit for the Gala and I'll make it for you. No problem at all. It will be my pleasure!",
    "Twilight Sparkle. I insist on making you a new dress.",
    "Not another word! I won't take no for an answer.",
    "Let me guess, Applejack. You don't want a new gown either.",
    "You can't possibly be serious, Applejack! You absolutely must wear formal attire.",
    "What if I just spruce up your... duds for you a little bit?",
    "Deal!",
    "Hmm... [gasp] Idea! I'll make you an outfit for the Gala too, Rainbow Dash.",
    "I'll make one for you and you and all of you. Oh! And of course Pinkie and Fluttershy too. Oh, and when I'm done, we can hold our very own fashion show!",
    "Oh, it'll be a little bit of work, but it will be a wonderful boost for my business. Plus, fun!",
    "Then it's settled. We'll have a fashion show starring us!",
    "Oh, Applejack. You make it sound as if it's going to be hard.{{#lstArt of the Dress|song}}",
    "That's it. Keep them closed. Don't look. Okay, you can look now!",
    "These are your new outfits. What do you think of your old duds now, Applejack? Pretty swanky, are they not? And Twilight! I made this dress for you and I designed each outfit theme to perfectly reflect each pony's unique personality. Oh, it took me forever to get the colors right on this one, Rainbow Dash, but I did it. Oh, and it turned out ''beautiful'', don't you think? And I know you are going to love yours, Fluttershy. It just sings spring! And Pinkie Pie, look! Pink! Your favorite! Aren't they all amazing?[pause]",
    "But what's the matter? Don't you like them?",
    "[sigh] That's okay. Not a problem. There's plenty more where that came from. They were only a first pass. You're my friends and I want you to be one hundred and ten percent satisfied. Not to worry, I'll redo them.",
    "I want them to be better than just fine. I want you to think they're absolutely perfect.",
    "Oh, it's no imposition. Really, I insist.",
    "[strained laughter] What have I gotten myself into?",
    "Fluttershy! Your new-new gown's ready. I completely revised it and I know you're going to love it. What do you think?",
    "Oh, you're just saying that.",
    "\"Nice\"?",
    "If you don't like it, you should just tell me.",
    "Like it or love it?",
    "Which is it?",
    "Well, just tell me what you really think.",
    "Tell me.",
    "Tell me!",
    "Tell me, tell me, tell-me-tell-me-tell-me!",
    "Oh, Opal. These are the ugliest dresses I've ever made.",
    "Okay. I did exactly what each of you asked for. Now don't hold back. Let me know what you really think.",
    "[sighs]",
    "Well, I'm... happy that all of you are happy. I'm just relieved to finally be done.[door opens]",
    "Hoity Toity? He's coming here? To see ''these'' dresses?",
    "Oh. [gasp] There he is!",
    "[deep breaths] Okay. Relax, Rarity. Your friends like their outfits and so will he. [squeals] What's wrong with the lights?! Oh, yes. That means the show's starting. Good.[music]",
    "[to Opal] Oh! Hide me.",
    "I'm never coming out! I can't show my face in Ponyville ever again! I used to be somepony. I used to be respected. I made dresses. Beautiful, beautiful dresses! But now everypony is laughing at me. I'm nothing but a laughing stock! [sobs]",
    "[sobbing] Leave me alone! I vant to be alone! I want to wallow in... whatever it is that ponies are supposed to wallow in! Do ponies wallow in pity? Oh, listen to me, I don't even know what I'm supposed to wallow in! I'm so pathetic!",
    "Exile... I guess technically I'd have to move away to live in exile. Where would I go? And what would I pack? Oh, it's going to take me forever to do all of that packing. What are you supposed to pack when you go to exile? Are you supposed to pack warm?",
    "Huh? Opal?",
    "Opal, how did you get up there? Hang on, you poor dear! Mama's coming![door opens]",
    "[gasp] Rainbow Dash?! How dare you strand my poor Opal in a tree?",
    "What is it? It's not... you... [gasp]",
    "Like it? Like it?!",
    "No, I don't like it.",
    "I love it!",

    "Oh, with the right outfit, you can do ''anything'', darling!",
    "Three weeks.",
    "Well then, how about a hat from the... [clears throat] ...clearance bin?[fabric ripping]",

    "[groans][zap!][boom!][rumbling]",
    "Go, Twilight! Get help!",
    "I'm sorry, darlings, but I can't possibly go to Appleloosa. I promised to deliver a new design to Fancy Pants for his Monocle and Top Hat Appreciation Society soiree.",
    "Well, I could. But you'll learn as you get older how important it is to keep your promises, especially when running a business.",
    "What?! Oh, my dear, no! Appleloosa is far too long a train ride for young foals without accompaniment. You could end up in the wrong place entirely. Why don't you see if Rainbow Dash is free?",
    "Now, Rainbow Dash, I don't think Fluttershy would have called us all here to talk about this if she thought it was funny. Everypony has things they like and things they don't.",
    "Honestly, Rainbow Dash, if you are not willing to put forth the effort required to pull a prank that everypony can enjoy, you may as well not pull one at all.",
    "I know you're excited about the Filly Guide Cookie Drive, but I still have to do a few finishing touches on your uniform.[beat]",
    "Huh. [reading] \"You asked for it.\"",
    "Hmm. I assume this is Dash's idea of a prank, which can only mean she's rigged some kind of booby trap to your Filly Guide uniform up there.",
    "We don't. If Dash thinks I'm going to fall for whatever she's got in mind, she's got another thing coming. There's more uniforms where that one came from![splat]",
    "Rainbow Dash!",
    "Are you honestly going to stand there and tell us you know nothing about all the pranking Rainbow Dash has been doing?",
    "Uh, since you and Dash share such an, uh, affinity for pranking, we thought you might be able to get her to, um, uh... quit it!",
    "You took the words right out of my mouth, Applejack. Isn't that right, Rainbow Dash?",
    "Of course it's quiet. Ponies can't talk while they're eating those fabulous cookies, heh.",
    "Of course. They're probably all in a cookie coma right now.",
    "Oh, of course not. I think the girls have earned a little celebration for all of their hard work. And I have plenty of sewing machine cake left over. Unless anypony wants a cookie...?",
    "Oh! There is certainly no call for that! There's plenty for everypony.",
    "Oh, Rainbow Dash, if you want all of those cookies, you will have to buy them, just like everypony else.",
    "Wh-wh-what... What's happening?",
    "What are you saying?",
    "That's lovely, darling, except for one thing... [droning] We've already eaten theeeeeeeeeemmmmm...",
    "Just delighting in pranking the prankster.",
    "Or if they'd even enjoy it?",
    "What ''I'' would do...[crowd gasps]",
    "...is pick flowers that accentuate my mane. It makes for a captivating color story when you present them to whomever they're intended.[boop][flowers rustling]",
    "Oh, darling, I need a dozen lavender pieces for Photo Finish's shoot on the most beautiful manes in Equestria.[beat]",
    "I know you're swamped, but it's for ''Vanity Mare''! She's going to take pictures of my mane, so color coordination is a must.",
    "Have you a single big one? If the wind came from one direction, it would really intensify the effect.",
    "Hmm. I do enjoy the windswept look, but other ponies might need to ''see'' it before they feel it.[switch clicks][door opens][ponies aah-ing]",
    "My mane will be flowing over the chaise in the tableau I have in mind. But I was hoping to choose the color. Could you make one in a pale yellow? I need something across the color wheel from this. [giggles]",
    "Pinkie? I need to put Photo Finish in a good mood, and nothing creates a better mood than your confecti\u2014 Ooh. Am I interrupting?",
    "[deadpan] Congratulations.",
    "[shrieks] Pinkie! I can't have Photo Finish shoot my mane like this! And this party string won't come off!",
    "[low growl]",
    "[shuddering sigh] It'll be fine, Pinkie. I'll find a way to clean this up before the shoot tomorrow. [whimper] Actually, you might consider doing the same.[stretching]",
    "[gasps] That's it! We'll pay a visit to Zecora! She's a wonder with a cauldron. I'm sure she can mix up a fix for both of us.",
    "I... think you may still have some baking to do.[eerie music]",
    "I do wish Zecora lived in town. One shouldn't have to brave the darkest part of the forest for shampoo.",
    "Well, uh... Hmm...I'm not sure that your style is quite right for this particular photo essay. Photo Finish travelled everywhere in her search for the most beautiful of manes.",
    "Well, yaks don't have manes, per se, and I'm not sure their style is quite what she's looking for either.[splash]",
    "Though at this moment, neither is mine.",
    "I'm sure you're right.[beat]",
    "Listen, spooky eyes! Why don't you take a picture?! It will last longer![creatures squeaking]",
    "On second thought, don't. Getting my picture taken in this state is what I'm trying to avoid!",
    "Are you ''certain'' that's safe?",
    "You really should bake new ones.",
    "Oh-ho, what a relief! I can't tell you how worried I was that my mane wouldn't be ready for the shoot. [laughs]",
    "Oh! [scoffs] Tell me about it!",
    "Well, I do enjoy a good yarn, but I'm not sure I could take anymore mane fright today.",
    "[screams][clatter]",
    "Uh-huh, hmm, yes, well, very entertaining. Uh, thanks for the shampoo. Ta-ta!",
    "[humming] A relaxing shower really gives you the chance to focus on the fabulosity of your mane! [laughs, sniff sniff] Not the most pleasant scent, but it gets the job done. [humming] My mane feels lighter alrea\u2014 [screams]",
    "It's important that you know that I am ''not'' pointing hooves, but\u2014",
    "Let's just say I understand why your shampoo hasn't made a splash in the marketplace.[cloak rustling]",
    "Goodness, Zecora! You could at least pretend it isn't that bad!",
    "Oh, thank goodness! I thought maybe your shampoo had triggered early-onset mare pattern baldness!",
    "[laughing] Oh, what a relief! Well, if you could just whip up a cure, I'll be on my way. So much to do before the shoot tomorrow.",
    "[mumbling] Sorry?",
    "W-w-w-w-w-w-wait, there's, there's a chance?! You ''think''?!",
    "[exhales] There's nothing to worry about. Zecora will have a cure before I've even finished my to-dos. But I don't know if I can even show my face looking like this!",
    "Uh, sorry. I, uh, believe it was my turn, and I-I-I-I just need to pick up some\u2014[flowers rustling]",
    "Oh, so kind of you to say. I-I\u2014",
    "N-Non-fabulous?![customers agreeing][ponies muttering]",
    "Oh, thank you, Davenport. Um, perhaps I can pick it up once everypony leav\u2014",
    "But\u2014 But\u2014 I\u2014 I\u2014",
    "[worried shriek]",
    "I can't believe how differently ponies treat you when you can't command their attention.",
    "\"Messed up\"? Does ''this'' look \"messed up\" to you?!",
    "Honestly! How hard is it to pretend it's not so bad?",
    "If today is any indication of how ponies will treat me from now on, I can't simply ''wait'' to see if my mane grows back!",
    "Yes, well, even if everypony isn't utterly indifferent to my presence, Zecora might not be able to fix this in time for the shoot. Can't you do a spell to restore some semblance of my mane?!",
    "Tricky! I know! I don't care! Make with the tricks!",
    "This won't do! I need an ''actual'' mane!",
    "More disastrous than this?![thump][magic zaps][flapping noise][scissors snipping]",
    "[panicked stuttering] B-But Zecora said there was still a chance![door opens]",
    "[sighs in relief] You mean I'll get my fabulous mane back in time for the shoot?",
    "[groans, bawling]",
    "I have always believed that the right outfit can make up for any other areas that are lacking. But I will need your honest opinions. [nervous ta-da] How awful is it?",
    "Oh, ''come on!'' Can't anypony pretend it's not bad?!",
    "Well, if any of ''you'' have an idea how to make this disaster look good enough for Photo Finish's piece in ''Vanity Mare'' on the most beautiful manes in Equestria, [sobbing] I'm open to hearing it!",
    "Hm?[Bessie being milked]",
    "I don't understand, Applejack. How is milking a cow going to help?",
    "It's a good idea, Applejack, but Photo Finish is looking for the most beautiful ''manes'', not bonnets.[thip]",
    "[gasps] You know, this is really quite fetching!",
    "...Just not portable.",
    "Oh, let's face it. I'll just have to call Photo Finish and cancel.",
    "[muffled] Come in.[bell rings]",
    "Would you mind closing the door? I'm more comfortable in the dark.[click]",
    "[sighs] It's lovely of you to say, but it's hard to argue with cold, hard facts.",
    "That without my mane, I simply can't shine as I once did, and ponies treat me like the sad, invisible pony I've become.",
    "Goodness... You're right! The only pony behaving differently today was me! Besides, what doesn't shine from the outside in...",
    "I'm preparing to shine from the inside out![guitar twang]",
    "I have a solution![guitar twang]",
    "Thank you. Although I'm afraid I missed my chance at ''Vanity Mare'', which means I have quite a few lavender arrangements to spare.",
    "Mm... The windswept look is ''very'' last-season. Perhaps you could set this up outside. It's sure to draw in the hoof traffic.[fan blowing]",
    "Photoshoot or no, you can always use a chaise!",
    "Oh, pshaw, Applejack. I'm simply making up for all the time I wasted feeling sorry for myself.",
    "I'm just glad I have all of you to remind me that even if I accidentally use magical remover potion on my mane, I can look good on the outside as long as I feel good on the inside.",
    "[gasps] Pinkie!",
    "If ''I'' had the remover potion this whole time, that means Pinkie must have the\u2014[door opens][flooding noise]",
    "...shampoo.",
    "Uh, perhaps I'll fetch the rest of that remover potion.",
    "So you're sure? You're sure it's fully recovered?",
    "Oh, honestly, Pinkie? After all I went through, I'm not sure it even matters what mane graces the page\u2014[whap]",
    "But I... I cancelled the shoot.",
    "I don't know what to say!",
    "Eugh. [chewing]",

    "Pardon me?",

    "I've got Applejack, darling. She's going to adore her present. There's a brilliant designer in Manehattan \u2013 Fedora Felt \u2013 who makes the most marvelous hats. I asked for a new take on western chic that would be the envy of every farm pony in Equestria.",
    "I expected a package today, and I was wondering where that might be.",
    "Uh, Rarity?",
    "What?! It was supposed to be delivered to Rarity's Boutique!",
    "[low growl] Yes, it's ''for'' Applejack, but ''I'' will be delivering it.",

    "Why is that a relief?!",
    "No! [clears throat] Uh, may I have the address for Sweet Acorn Orchard? I think I'll just collect the package myself.",
    "You have helped so much already.",

    "The hat is indeed for somepony very special. And I couldn't bear to see ''him'' part with it.",

    "Well...",
    "[grunting] A little help, please!",
    "Whoa!",
    "[sighs] At least Twilight has something to show for her effort. I ordered you a fabulous farm hat, Applejack. Alas, it decided it belonged to somepony else.",

    "I take it from your reaction that you like the boutique?",
    "Well, despite my 'nubby scrubby buffy pony pedi, I actually have been working very hard! However, I never could have gotten the boutique ready for the grand opening without the help of my new manager Sassy Saddles!",
    "I knew I needed a manager for Canterlot Carousel, so when Sassy showed me her resum\u00e9 and I saw that she worked in all of the finest boutiques in Canterlot, I hired her right on the spot!",
    "So I created a collection that beautifully revolves around the royal element of Canterlot!",
    "[to Twilight] In every poll Sassy Saddles took, ''you'' were the most popular princess! Coincidentally, one of my gowns is inspired by the window in Canterlot Castle commemorating your coronation![curtains unfurling]",
    "While I've always prided myself on paying attention to detail, I've taken my latest collection to a whole new level with \"Rarity's Rules of TLC\"!",
    "TLC stands for 'Time, Love, and Couture'. And while I do agree that this dress has potential, I've not had enough ''time'' to give it enough ''love'' to become ''couture''.[door shuts]",
    "But the rest of the gowns in tonight's line have met Rarity's Rules and are ready to be presented!",
    "So, Twilight, we were wondering if perhaps you might possibly wear this tonight?",
    "Ever since I was a little filly, all I've ever wanted was to own a boutique here in Canterlot. Somepony pinch me! I'm about to open the doors to that very boutique![door opens]",
    "Oh, I don't think she meant to.",
    "Yes, I am. Fluttershy, could you help Twilight get ready?",
    "Fillies and gentlecolts! I am designer and couturier Rarity, I'd like to welcome you\u2014again [laughs nervously]\u2014to the grand opening of Canterlot Carousel, and I'm thrilled that you are here to see my newest collection inspired by this regal city![crowd oohs][camera clicking][BGM starts]",
    "Fashion Plate of ''Cosmare'' magazine! I'm so honored that ''Cosmare'' was able to do a piece on the grand opening of my boutique!",
    "Oh, uh, it's called \"Rarity's Royal Regalia\".",
    "My favorite part of being a designer is finding my inspiration, and that really wasn't difficult when it came to Canterlot. Everywhere I looked, the royal city just spoke to me! I call it \"In-''spire''-ation\".[crowd oohs]",
    "I spent hours by the lily pond on the castle grounds, which inspired this gown\u2014\"Water Filly\"![crowd oohs]",
    "Watching Celestia raise the sun each morning literally lit up my day... [beat] This is \"Tripping the Light\".[crowd oohs]",
    "[giggles] And of course, Luna raising the moon guided me to sleep. I call this \"Over the Moon\"![crowd oohs]",
    "And for our finale, I have something ''very'' special. I was inspired by the stained glass window created in honor of Princess Twilight... I call this \"The Reign in Stain\"!",
    "\u2014stained glass window of a reigning princess!",
    "Yes!",

    "[stammering] But... But receiving orders for one hundred dresses in one day, [stammering] it's just too much too soon!",
    "Wha... But... [stammering] Uh, n-no, Sassy. Promises were made, and I shall sew my very best to provide each and every pony a Princess Dress full of TLC.",
    "[sighs]",
    "No, Sassy. These orders are my responsibility. All I have to do is stick to my plan so I can deliver each and every Princess Dress in keeping with my Rules of Rarity!{{#lstRules of Rarity|song}}[door opens][bell rings]",

    "What?! No!",
    "''Stop!'' This is ''not'' your boutique! And if this is what success in Canterlot looks like, I want no part of it! Now, make up flyers for a going-out-of-business sale! ''I'm closing Canterlot Carousel!''",

    "And I'm sure you'll feel even brighter once you try it on!",
    "Oh, yes, I do. It's-It's right here.",
    "Hmmm. Perhaps you'd be even more taken with this one. It was inspired by the fountain in the Canterlot Castle garden. I call it the \"Fountain of Truth\"!",

    "Attention, everypony! Canterlot Carousel will ''not'' be closing![crowd cheering]",
    "[giggles] Yes, yes, of course.",
    "Well, so did the Princess Dress. The more I sold, the more each dress lost its time, love, and couture, becoming terrible, lackluster, and common.",
    "I beg your pardon? The Rules of Rarity are ''only'' to be applied at Canterlot Carousel! Which is why you must continue to manage the boutique while I'm in Ponyville.",
    "Well, yes, I'll come to Canterlot with new designs and to see the customers of course, but Ponyville was always going to be my home base.",
    "I would expect nothing less.",
    "and",
    "I'm sure the festivities will be just lovely.",
    "MMMM?",
    "Although, you would look rather dapper in a tuxedo.",

    "Fine, I'm guilty! [crying] I wear false eyelashes! Oh, and I took a bite of the cake.",
    "You just made it sound so delectable.",
    "I only meant to take a little, lady-like bite.",

    "[simultaneously] ''What?!''",
    "We need to think like our students. If someone told us we would never see each other again, what would we do?",
    "And I saw him in a shop buying pillows and blankets!",
    "But this time, we guarantee it shall be different.",
    "Well, how would you like to help create Ponyville's finest birds' nests?",
    "Why yes. When the weather team guides the birds back north for the spring, they'll need a place to live and lay their eggs.",
    "Oh why, thank you most sincerely. Would you like to try your hoof at a nest?",
    "Okay. Now... uh, take some of that straw and hay over there, and a little bit of branch. Now, weave them through there, ''yes''. Uh, take some ribbon, ''yes'', oh uh, n... not there, oooh, yes, uh, tuck it in over there, uh but be careful not to... I don't know I guess that would do... oh dear.",

    "Simply ''the'' most important reason I've ever had in my entire life!",
    "I've heard rumors that the Castle of the Two Sisters is filled with the most gorgeous of ancient tapestries in all of pony history! It pains me to think of those magnificent creations rotting away in those old ruins, totally unappreciated.",
    "I require your help in ''borrowing'' one or two to bring back to the boutique where I can restore them. Maybe I'll even use the patterns as the inspiration for a new line!",
    "Yes, well, [clears throat] maybe not ''the'' most important thing in my ''entire'' life, but retro-ancient classical will be all the rage next season, so it's nothing to sneeze at. [sneezes]",
    "But, of course. Although, I must admit these ruins ''are'' a fright. Just look at all the dirt everywhere! Ugh...",

    "Not home? Darling, I would never miss a fitting.",
    "[scoffing] Darling! The perfect fit is imperative! And as for my time, well, I am far from the most generous pony in Equestria.",
    "Why, of course it is. How ''can'' you be so insensitive? Oh, just look at him. Such lovely luminescent scales.",
    "And your expertly coiffed mane.",
    "Your fabulous manicure.",
    "All ruined without your beautiful mustache.",
    "I simply cannot let such a crime against fabulosity go uncorrected.",
    "You look smashing.",
    "Oh. It's fine, my dear. Short tails are in this season. Besides, it'll grow back.",
    "Oh, I gave some designs to the costume designer, so he pulled a few strings.",
    "That is what makes Manehattan so splendid and amazing. You do something nice for somepony, and then you never know when they'll do something nice for you!",
    "Yes, I suppose I've had my generous moments. Although I haven't always been perfect.[sewing machines whirring]",
    "Twilight! Sew these pieces together according to that pattern there!",
    "Don't fret. It'll be here in an hour. That's not going to be a problem, is it?",
    "Oh! I see! I go out of my way to get you tickets for a show, and this is how you repay me? By abandoning me in my hour of need? Oh, oh, oh! Fine! Go and see ''Hinny of the Hills'' tonight! And then tomorrow morning when you come to see my fashion show without any fashion to show, you can have more entertainment! \"Oh, why look, there's our friend Rarity going down in flames! ''Isn't friendship magic?!''\"",
    "What's gotten into ''you''?! Oh, go ahead! See your little show! Congratu-pony-lations, fillies! Sounds like you've all figured out already it's everypony for herself in this town![door slams][sewing machines whirring][clicking]",
    "[gasps] Finally!",
    "[gasps] The Applewood Derby?! [excited giggling] Of course I'll help!",
    "Me? Oh, why, I'm just itching to right an old wrong from long, long ago!",
    "[narrating] I designed my own cart when I was just a filly, and I was positive I was going to win the prize for most creative, hooves down! But I came in second. Second!",
    "[narrating] But I learned a valuable lesson.",
    "I learned to know my audience, and the race cart audience wants big! They want bold![door opens]",
    "Chop chop! Everypony out!",
    "We've got work to do![door closes]",
    "This will take all of my considerable skills... [humming to self][scribbling]",
    "...but I will fashion the biggest and boldest Derby cart to ever win the prize for most creative!",
    "Oh! [tittering] Please, darling, leave tradition to the Apples. We're doing ''big'', we're doing ''bold''! [humming to self] Soon the prize for most creative will finally be in my hooves!",
    "Yes, that's what I said \u2013 ''my'' hooves.",
    "[muffled] Oh-ho-ho-ho, darling, [normal] the fringe is not exactly ''big''! And that yellow is the least ''bold'' color I can imagine!",
    "Sweetie Belle, precious face, \"old-timey\" is just another word for pass\u00e9. Remember, ''big'' and ''bold''! I do have a reputation to uphold! It was one thing to lose as a filly, but can you imagine if I didn't win the most creative now? Ponies might stop buying my couture!",
    "Yes, of course we are, darling. In fact, ''we'' just finished. ''Voila!'' I know. You're speechless. Well, if that isn't ''big'' and ''bold'', I don't know what is! Isn't it wonderful? [humming to self]",
    "I was expecting an audience with the Princess, not outdoor sport. Agh. Oh my...",
    "Yes... I like very much... No! No, I shan't succumb to such fabulousness. Must... get to the center... to meet... the others. [grunt] Mine!",
    "Well, Rarity. It took forever, but it was worth it. Who knew three little gemstones would turn out to be this handsome ''hunk'' of a diamond? Now to get you home. [grunts][wall crash]",
    "What do you mean, \"boulder\"? This big beautiful bedazzling rock is a diamond! And it's all mine. Keep your envious little eyes off it! I found it and it's mine fair and square! [grunting]",
    "No! I mean, yes. Well, not exactly. You see, I asked that delightful family of raccoons from my shop in Manehattan to help out. [forced laugh] Smoky! Softpad! Careful with the [through gritted teeth] expensive fabrics! [clears throat] Yes, well, where were we? Uh... [gasps] Ah, yes. It's so nice to have a chance to reminisce. Everypony's so busy with the coronation. Still can't believe it's happening. [laughs] You really are an inspiration to ponies everywhere.",

This reporter, for one, is a believer.\" [to ponies] Why didn't you tell me there were so many problems?",
    "[giggles] \"Ne'er-do-wells\" or not, I know I can always count on all of you. And nothing could be more perfect than that.",
    "I appreciate hearing how much I'm appreciated. [laughs]",
    "You've been very patient today, Spike. And for that, you get the finest reward. This is from me to you.",
    "Is something wrong, Spike?",
    "Oh! [chuckles] How's your shopping going, Spike?",
    "[whispering] Which pony did you get?",
    "I've got Applejack, darling. She's going to adore her present. There's a brilliant designer in Manehattan \u2013 Fedora Felt \u2013 who makes the most marvelous hats. I asked for a new take on western chic that would be the envy of every farm pony in Equestria.",
    "Over the years, my relationship with Spike has changed, but it will always be very special.[crunch!]",
    "No! I mean... No, you can't move. Uh, for the fitting, you see. If you start to move too much, then we'll have to do it all over again. [nervous laugh] So... I, uh, I will go check on my animal assistants.[zip!]",
    "[hushed] What exactly are you doing back here?! Surely you have enough memories by now!",
    "Now, where were we? I must say, I'm quite enjoying this fitting. I may not be the ruler of Equestria, but it is nice to hear how I've inspired ponies with my meager talent for fashion. [laughs]",
    "Perhaps ''I'' should take it from here! You castle guards have such a difficult job. I'm guessing that at times it can be rather... boring.",
    "And of course being a castle guard can be thankless work. I'm not saying you did, but ''if'' you took a break, you ''more'' than deserved it.",
    "What kind of cake was it?",
    "Was the frosting vanilla or chocolate?",
    "Was the base of the cake decorated with buttercream rosettes?",
    "[narrating] ''Rainbow Dash was questioning my methods. But I knew what I was doing.''",
    "Sure... Hmm.[hard rock solo]",
    "[sighs] Much better.",
    "[groans]",
    "[sniffles]",
    "Of course I am. It's just lovely to hear when a friend thinks highly of you. [clears throat] All right. Looks like they\u2014 ''I'' have everything I need.",
    "Oh. [laughing] Oh, that's not your coronation gown. I finished that weeks ago.",
    "That is a backup. One can never be too careful when it comes to a coronation. I like to have all of my bases covered.",
    "Ohhhh![door opens][door closes][credits]{{Transcripts}}{{Infobox Transcript}}",
    "Do we have Spike to thank again for this amazing spread? Isn't he simply amazing?",
    "Spike, you are such a little star that I had to make a little bow tie for you.",
    "Oh, poor little thing.",

    "I'm sorry, but my mane wasn't made to support marine life! Ruined, completely ruined.",
    "Throw it away? Yes, I agree. Just another innocent casualty of that disastrous boat trip.",
    "Please, darling. I don't know if I'll ''ever'' be able to discuss it. It's far too painful! [gasps dramatically]",
    "Well, since you dragged it out of me... It all started at the docks. I knew Applejack and Pinkie Pie wanted to get out of their element, so I thought I would surprise them with an elegant cruise.",
    "[narrating] I had brought a small bag with just a few key essentials. [in-world] All right, ponies! Prepare yourselves for luxury on the high seas!",
    "I... have no idea what you just said, but your wardrobe is delightfully seaworthy.",
    "[narrating] Despite Applejack's colorful seafarer attitude, ''I'' was still determined to get my friends out of their element by providing them with all the refinements of a luxury cruise. I made sure to bring the most delectable nibbles for them to enjoy.",
    "Oh, Pinkie Pie, that all looks positively delectable. But you simply must try one of these cucumber sandwiches. Dig in!",
    "Oh! I'm so sorry! I had no idea you had such distaste for cucumbers!",
    "Well, hold on, because it gets even worse. Pinkie tried to lighten the mood with some fun maritime games.",
    "Oh, darling, of course![lightning cracks]",
    "Ahem. Er, Applejack? Just a thought, but maybe we should steer the ship toward calmer waters.",
    "Perhaps if I took a quick look-see at that map of yours, I could find us a more cruise-friendly path\u2014",
    "[narrating] Clearly, Pinkie Pie had caught Applejack's sea madness.",
    "[arguing][splash]",
    "Oh, the boat sank. Obviously. [blows]",
    "After all the effort I put in to provide her and Pinkie with the exact luxury cruise they needed to get out of their elements, ''that'' is how Applejack thanked me!",
    "[sighs] Spike, darling, you'll have to forgive me. I am far too emotionally drained to discuss the matter any further!",
    "Well! I can assure you that that is ''exactly'' what happened! But if you don't believe ''me'', you can ask Pinkie Pie. I'm quite certain her story will be the same.",
    "Prepare yourselves for a luxury cruise! A day of opulence, decadence, and extravagance!",
    "Oh, Pinkie Pie, those all look simply... well, simple. But they're obviously unfit for a luxury cruise. Now, my cucumber sandwiches, on the other hoof... Try one, then you'll understand.",
    "Sorry! Cucumber sandwiches are ''so'' ten seconds ago.",
    "[exaggerated posh laugh] ...Oh. You were serious. Well, that's adorable.",
    "[grunting]",
    "[grunting]",
    "Oh, don't worry, dear. Luxury cruises never sink.",
    "La-la-la! Prepare yourselves for the most luxurious boat outing that ever outed a boat!",
    "Oh, darling, that food isn't fit for a pony of proper breeding, darling, and refinement, darling! Now my cucumber sandwiches, on the other hoof...",
    "Pinkie, darling, please!",
    "Well, I never! Hum-ph!",
    "Oh, darling, whacking is a base pastime for common ponies. Doesn't interest me in the least.",
    "Ooh! Why, this will make a perfect tablecloth for my cheeseboard!",
    "[yelps][splash]",
    "[panting] Opalescence delivered your message, Twilight! What's the emergency?",
    "What's ''she'' doing here?!",
    "An apology?!",
    "What are ''you'' talking about? Applejack clearly caused the boat to sink! She stranded us in the middle of the ocean!",
    "[gasps]",
    "Well... Maybe it wasn't the ''middle'' of the ocean...",
    "On that, at least, we agree.",
    "Well, not that ''I'' have any doubts, but it will feel good for everypony to see exactly ''whose'' fault it was.",
    "And why would you waste a perfectly good hors d'oeuvre?",
    "With cucumber sandwiches?",
    "So that's a...",
    "All right. Even if our friend the bunyip is responsible for sinking the boat, it still doesn't excuse a certain pony's behavior!",
    "And I was just trying to give the two of you the elegant cruise I thought you deserved.",
    "Ohhhh.",
    "That is so sweet. You must have gone through so much trouble.",
    "Oh, let's never fight again!",
    "Terribly sorry, darling. I'm afraid I'm... I'm not good with the thundery ones.",
    "Whatever do you mean, Twilight? I'm simply doing what I've done since the day it first appeared. Does my sky look fabulous or what?[ponies complaining]",
    "Too last season?",
    "Why, you've become an Alicorn. I didn't even know that was possible.",
    "And terribly far away.",
    "In the middle of my friendship quilting class? I think not! All of those unfinished seams! [faints]",
    "A glamour spell on our cutie marks?",
    "I didn't see you there, my apologies.",
    "I just wish Pinkie Pie were here so we could tell her how much we all appreciate her hard work.",
    "We're not going to judge you, darling.",
    "Stand still, Rainbow Dash.",
    "''Do'' you want to look nice for Princess Celestia or not?",
    "Mmhmm. Thank you, Twilight. Nice to know ''someone'' appreciates my talents.",
    "Huh?",
    "Me too. Oh, they're perfect.",
    "[baby talk]",
    "Not only are you adorable, but you're also quite useful.",
    "Oh! Are you okay? Aaah! [gasp] ''Eewww''. Aaah! Gross gross ''gross''! No creature that behaves so revoltingly is allowed in my boutique!",

[clears throat] But I couldn't possibly head back home without mentioning what ''handsome scales'' you have. And those scales have to be hidden away in some ''silly'' cave for a hundred years?",
    "Personally, ''I'' think you should skip the snoozing and be out ''there'', ''showing'' them off. Hmm. Obviously, I would be ''more'' than happy to keep an eye on your jewels while you're gone.",

    "We're breaking for tea and biscuits!",
    "[gasps] [screaming]",
    "How did you\u2014",
    "Darling, change is an integral part of fashion. I myself am considering opening boutiques for non-ponies. Things must evolve, or they become stale. For example... I was just struck with a sudden inspiration to change my design for your gown by including the webs of these star spiders. They glow for a short while after they're spun. They won't have much time to weave the sash, but the effect will be dazzling. You see, darling? Change can be fabulous if you embrace it![doors open]",
    "Oh, you won't be traveling alone, darling. I'll have just enough time on the train to weave the star spider sash for your gown. But we should leave now. There's no time to dawdle if you want the coronation to be perfect.",
    "I suppose it gave us something else to focus on.",
    "Rattled to the core.",
    "I just can't stop thinking about how much things are going to change!",
    "I'd worked out exactly how much time I needed to weave my star spider sash, and now I'm behind!",
    "''NO!'' She can't possibly be crowned without wearing her coronation gown!",
    "You look amazing. Ooh! I almost forgot!",
    "But now that we'll be living in different places, I'm not exactly sure how.",
    "[screams, sighs, sighs again]",
    "I'm going to call you \"Repeatie Belle\"! We've been through this! Please let me concentrate! [sighs]",
    "You've more than earned them.",
    "Oh, that's just awful.",
    "You can count on us!",
    "Oh! That was exquisite!",
    "Hearing you all mention these experts, I am reminded that I too have the perfect pony to help capture the essence of your vision. To give it some style, some flair! [chuckles]",
    "[chuckles] No! No. Um, I was referring to the premiere interior designer of the Canterlot elite \u2013 Dandy Grandeur. He helped me when I was setting up my Canterlot boutique. I know that he'd be thrilled to work with you.",
    "Ooooh! Loving the print on those!",
    "When a client has a vision... [chuckles]",
    "I never would've invited Dandy to help if I thought he'd act in such a manner.",
    "[simultaneously] That's the spirit!",
    "They're different, that's all. Very... different.",
    "Yes! These are some of my favorite materials. Very rare, imported from the Crystal Empire to match your northern sensibilities. I hope you'll find them\u2014",
    "...delicious.",
    "Satisfactory, I'd say.",
    "We have absolute confidence in your abilities, Pinkie Pie.",
    "She's simply vanished!",
    "I just wish Pinkie Pie were here so we could tell her how much we all appreciate her hard work.",
    "I wonder if it's a filly or a colt?",
    "Baby unicorns get strange magic surges that come and go.",
    "''Moi?'' Babysit? N- Oh nonononononononono! I'm flattered that you would think about me though.",
    "I must say, speaking strictly on aesthetics, there really doesn't need to be more to it. It's all simply divine!",
    "[sighs] Very well.[beat]",
    "Right. Let's get down there and find the spa.",
    "It could certainly use a few more architectural flourishes. Or ''any'' architectural flourishes.",
    "[gasps] What in the name of Equestria is ''that''?!",
    "[gagging] Wha\u2014 Ooh, er, perhaps another time, good sir, thank you. [whispering] No wonder nopony's wearing anything!",
    "Oh, please, Miss Pie! This is hardly the time for jokes! We've come all this way and for what?",
    "We have differing opinions all the time, darling.",
    "[laughs nervously] Well, w-we certainly didn't intend to cause any disruptions to your charming little\u2014",
    "My, my, my! What boasting!",
    "Just because one has the ability to perform lots of magic does ''not'' make one better than the rest of us.",
    "[raspberry] Just who does she think she is?",
    "Enough. Enough, all of you. I take your hint, but Rarity is above such nonsense. Rainbow Dash and Applejack may behave like ruffians, but Rarity conducts herself with beauty and grace.",
    "Oh, it. Is. On! You may think you're tough with all of your so-called powers, but there's more to magic than your brutish ways. A unicorn needs to be more than just muscle. A unicorn needs to have style.",
    "A unicorn is not a unicorn without grace and beauty.",

    "Oh, y\u2014 Right. [laughs, clears throat] Well, if your trained eye happens to see a chartreuse gem, I'm desperate to find one.",
    "Oh, you're an absolute darling! This will surely make my gown stand out at Countess Coloratura's album release party. Do you know how rare this is?",
    "Huh?[rocks crumbling, gems falling out]",
    "Why do you protest so? You've already given up wearing your crown all the time. The least you can do is embrace your new title.",
    "You look amazing, darling. They've really captured your regality.",
    "Oh, don't be so modest. It's everypony's dream to someday wear a crown and have their coronation ceremony preserved in stained glass for all to see. [sighs]",
    "It doesn't feel right to us either, darling. If the Mayor wasn't so desperate for our assistance, we'd most certainly stay here in Canterlot. And of course we do understand that your royal duties must come first.",
    "[general agreement]",
    "Cross my heart and hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my eye.",

    "Something very strange is going on, and- [gasps] I for one would appreciate an explanation!",
    "Alas, this whole raging forest situation seems to have left my horn on the fritz!",
    "Oh, thank goodness!",

    "Apparently, DJ Pon-3 has a residency at the Party Palace upstairs, but security won't let me speak to her.[honk!]",
    "Aah! What in the name of Celestia was that?!",
    "[sighs] We'll have to do something about that, after I think of a way to quiet down that music. And after I finish designing the window display![crash!]",
    "Ahh! Wait, is this my merchandise shipment from Ponyville? It's completely disorganized! A\u2014A\u2014... [sighs]",
    "Gesundheit! Oh, Miss Pommel! I'm so glad to see you! Now, as the sole sales associate at Rarity For You, I hate to add to your already overflowing plate of responsibilities, but it looks as though we have just a tad more to do before tonight than I thought.",
    "Oh? Why not?",

    "Yes. I know what needs to be done. I just need more of me! Oh, how I wish I could make copies of myself!",

    "[clears throat]",
    "This all sounds splendid, but I don't even have a single employee, and I'll need the best of the best.",
    "Oh! This is it, my dears. If you can handle these problems, I'll focus on the designs for the front window display. We'll show Manehattan what Rarity For You is all about! Oh, what would I do without you?",
    "Now for the perfect window display. Hmm.[dance music playing]",
    "A window display is the first thing customers see, and if they like it, they'll walk inside and experience the glory that is my boutique.",

    "[giggle] How may I help you, Sapphire?",
    "I have just what you need. Sapphire Shores, prepare yourself for the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance de la haute couture. I used every last diamond I found on this one garment.",

    "Yes, Spike! Right there!",
    "Spike! I promised I'd give you gems to snack on, but we need to collect more first or I'll never be able to make these outfits for Sapphire.",
    "Come along, Spike. We have many jewels to find.",
    "Spike![jackhammer sounds]",
    "You've been very patient today, Spike, and for that you get the finest reward. This is from me to you. Is something wrong, Spike?",
    "Ooo, bring the cart, Spike. There are more over here.",
    "Spike! Where are you?",
    "You know, it's terrible to keep a lady waiting.",
    "I think we're really going to strike gold this time. So to speak. [laugh]",
    "Well, Spike, I think that's all we can do for today. And these will certainly get me well on my way with Sapphire's outfits. Why don't we start headi... oh! What's this? Another jewel. Oh... oh, strange. It's in the trees. Oooo\u2014 ''eww''! Uh... uh... good day, gentle... uh, fellow. Uh, I am Rarity and this is my friend Spike.",
    "And you are...",
    "Oh really? Oh well, that explains your fine taste in jewelry. I mean I-I-I know that diamonds are a girl's best friend and now I know that they're a dog's best friend too, ha ha ha. So, um, [cough] you're out hunting for gems as well?",
    "Uh... we?",

    "Spike! Come on! Hurry!",
    "Waah! ''Spike''!",

    "Aaaah!",

    "Oh please, Diamond Dogs. Please let me go.",
    "But whatever do you want from me?",
    "Oh! Is that all? There. A lovely pocket of jewels are right there. Now, if you'd be so kind as to show me the exit?",
    "What? But you said you wanted me to ''find'' the gems.",
    "Dig?",
    "''Ohh...'' [grunting]",
    "Forgive me, but prior to you so rudely dragging me into your dirt pit, I had a pony-pedi and I am not about to chip a hoof because you dislike my style of digging. [grunting]",
    "I beg your pardon, but what, pray tell, are you doing?",
    "Well, somebody certainly needs proper nail care. When was the last time you two had a manicure? You're scratching up my coat with those jagged things!",
    "Good heavens, what ''is'' that smell?",
    "Ah, mystery solved. It's your breath.",
    "Well, since you insist... but I must say the working conditions in here are simply dreadful. Musty and damp, it's going to wreak havoc on my mane. And this air is stifling, suffocating. And when I try to take a deep breath, the stench of all you dogs makes me nauseated.[crash]",
    "You look and smell like you haven't bathed in weeks. Have you never heard of soap? You could all do with a good round of soap and water. Oh water, oh water, I'm terribly thirsty. Could I please have some water?",

    "Twilight is a very capable pony. I'm sure she can figure out what to do next.",
    "Of course. [gasps] Why don't we pop back so you could explain to Twilight what to do next, and then we'll come back here and pick up where we left off?",

    "Twilight, darling! How in the world did you end up there?",
    "Well, if watching Applejack fix plumbing counts as relaxing, then yes.",

    "Is there something wrong with your face?",
    "Ooh, precious pants, that does look uncomfortable. But even I get the odd blemish from time to time. It's nothing to be embarrassed by. You could pay Zecora a visit. She makes a cream that works wonders. Just don't get the shampoo.",

    "But I wonder if you wouldn't mind taking it off.",

I hope that incredibly pungent odor belongs to some sort of magical curative. [loudly] I hope you're not busy, but I must have my hearing back! It turns out that I talk to myself while I sew, and without that conversation, I simply can't think!",
    "[sighs, normal volume] Oh, thank you. You're an ear saver. [loudly] Oh, and while I am here, do you have any blemish cream?! Spike is having some scale issues!",

    "Oh, Spike. What are you doing here?",
    "Yes, what? [loudly] I was just at Zecora's, but I'm heading back! I can't read these instructions! Does this say \"two drops once a day\" or \"one drop twice a day\"?!",

    "She was so impressed that she wants to take some pictures of my shop featuring some of my clothes!",

    "Hm... She's going to want to see attitude and pizzazz.",
    "More light! It has to catch the sequins just so or the whole outfit is just a disaster. Oh, and the headdress needs more feathers. Pinkie Pie! More feathers! And sequins! More sequins!",
    "And more ribbon! Oh no! Less ribbon. No! More ribbon.",

    "I'm jealous! I wanted all the attention. And instead it was going to you. I even started hoping that you would do something silly so your modeling career would be over. But then, when it started happening, all I could think was how could I want you to fail at something you love so much?",
    "You do?",
    "Then why did you keep doing it?",

    "Touch\u00e9.",
    "Remember that time I crashed into all those books attempting my sonic rainboom after you guys ''just'' cleaned up? [laughs, sighs] That was good times.",
    "And there may or may not be some Daring Do posters up in your library.",
    "You got it!",
    "And my team gave the all clear from Fillydelphia to Las Pegasus.",
    "Hey, Twilight, another Pegasus just got back from Baltimare with an all-clear and\u2013 [laughs] What's going on? Aren't you gonna stop him?",

    "Oh no!",
    "Uhhh... I'm not so sure that's a\u2013",
    "Y'know... it really doesn't look ''too'' bad...",
    "[distant] Oh, come on! Tell 'em the fun part!",
    "That's right! All you gotta do is show Ms. Harshwhinny the coolest, most spectacular, most rocking routine and you're going to the Games! So who's going to be the lucky ponies?!",
    "So, the winning team gets to carry the Ponyville flag at the Equestria Games! Oh, you are gonna ''love'' this!",
    "Aw, get to the nitty-gritty later. Tell 'em the important stuff! Like who's the coach! [blows whistle] That's right! Me! And you know why I'm qualified to coach you? Guess who carried the Cloudsdale flag in the Games when ''she'' was a little filly? Me! I'll never forget it\u2014I burst into the stadium, spreading my wings, the flag flapping in the breeze. I did tricks with that flag the likes of which nopony saw before and nopony's seen since![thud]",
    "Yes, Ms. Harshwhinny. Y'know, \"professionalism\" is my middle name. Rainbow Professionalism Dash.",
    "Ahem. Yes. Quite, quite correct. In the meantime, get ready to train, and train hard, because I know this opening ceremony is the single most important thing that will ever happen in your young lives! But, I know you're up for the challenge. And so am I! Wooho\u2014! Ahem... meet me after school tomorrow at 1500 hours. Sharp. And show me your flag carrying skills. I am outta here. Professionally. See how professionally?",
    "Show me what you got, Cutie Mark Crusaders, and make it good!",
    "That was ''ama''\u2014 [thinking] ''Wait. Hold on now. Gotta stay calm, cool and collected.'' [aloud] To give a calm, clear analysis\u2014 wait. You whipped that act together just ''yesterday''?! That is\u2014 [thinking] ''Professionalism, Dash, keep those emotions in check!'' [aloud] Overall, it was... kinda, sorta... [quickly] overall, it was okay. Keep working hard. Who knows? You might have a shot. Gotta go!",
    "Okay, Cutie Mark Crusaders, this is your final run before you show it at the stadium tomorrow. I know you're gonna absolutely, positively\u2014 have a lot of fun, heheh. Okay, go! [blows whistle]",
    "That's... y'know... good and all, heheh... I just thought... maybe possibly you might wanna go back to, say, the first version of the act, which was, I dunno, what's the word, better? Just do the routine as it was! Don't mess with success, right? Seriously. Now I need to... go coach these other ponies! And don't forget, we've got to catch the early train for the Crystal Empire. See you in the morning!",
    "How's my favorite routine going today? Oh, I just can't keep it in! I want you to win so bad! [to the BGM] Bom, bom, bom, bom... and then Scootaloo does that [half-whistles] through the hoop!",
    "She's ''what''?!",
    "And then you tried to stop her from doing that, right?",
    "Hang on. Are you ''nuts''?! You're a team, and a team never leaves a friend behind![ding][brakes squealing]",
    "Come on!",
    "Put on some speed, girls![ripping noises][clang]",
    "Throwing away your ''scooter''?!",
    "Yup, but not just me.",
    "What's gotten into you, Scootaloo?",
    "And who said you had to?",
    "But that was me! You're you! And it just doesn't matter if you can fly or not. Your routine was amazing 'cause it represented exactly what makes Ponyville special. You ''do'' still know what that is, right?",
    "Listen, Scootaloo. Maybe you'll fly someday, or maybe you won't. You're all kinds of awesome anyway. Who's the toughest little pony in town?{{#lstHearts Strong as Horses|reprise}}[crowd cheering]",
    "Ahem. Look. What you three did was... acceptable.",
    "Contain your excitement, Ms. Harshwhinny. Remember \u2013 ''professionalism''.",

    "Spring training was awesome, but I can't wait to see my friends![locker door closes]",
    "I'm gonna catch up on some ''Daring Do'' with Twilight, help Applejack make my favorite cider, and have a sleepover with Pinkie!",

    "[sighs][cutie mark ringing]",
    "Huh? Oh, the map!",
    "Hey, Twilight! So where am I going? The Crystal Mountains? Vanhoover? Here? Please say here.",
    "Awesome! [beat] Does that mean there's bad news?",
    "[groans] I was just there!{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}[whoosh]",
    "Ahem.",
    "[sighs wistfully] I remember when she said that to me.",
    "Official friendship business.",
    "[sighs] Adorable. They're so full of hope and competition. Eh, their technique could use some work, though.",
    "Nah. I wouldn't want to mess with their confidence.",
    "We can?",
    "Count us in!",
    "Maybe for you. I practically fell asleep when I went through this. Tell you what. I'll leave the teaching stuff to you, and I'll just make sure they stay awake! [blows airhorn][Twilight's ears ringing]",
    "[chuckles] Good one, Twilight.[door opens]",
    "[blows airhorn]",
    "Wake up, newbies! Class is in session!",
    "But you can call us \"T-Sparks\" and \"The Dashinator\"!",
    "[laughs nervously] Just kidding.",
    "Who said that?!",
    "What's your name?",
    "[unimpressed] Huh. That's pretty impressive.",
    "But you'll have to in the solo trials.",
    "Yup. It's a part of your final evaluation.",
    "That's a mighty big claim, considering everypony here is an amazingly awesome crazy-good flyer.",

    "[cricks neck, yawns] Yeah, nopony fell asleep. What? I'm not a student!",
    "Me or Twilight? Probably Twilight.",
    "Tell you what. It's almost time for your freestyle training. Why don't you grab her and show us what you got?",
    "But did you see Vapor Trail? Her wing was under his. I think she gave him a boost.",
    "Sky obviously has no idea he's not actually amazingly awesome.",
    "Fix it without telling them.|",
    "Of course not! Flying is like thirty percent skill and seventy percent confidence! You can't mess with a flyer's confidence!",
    "Yeah, but if we tell them that they've been holding each other back, that could be trouble too!",
    "Will do![locker opens]",
    "Hey, you did great. You're a really strong flyer.",
    "You've been doing ''great''!",
    "[sighs] Not without you. And it's gonna be pretty obvious during the solo trials when he can't get enough air to do a flipping loop.",
    "You need to work on your tricks, and Sky needs to be able to fly without you or he won't make it.",
    "Then we have to find a way to help both of you.",
    "Yes! Hah-hah! I love being right! Okay, here's what we do. Sky needs to build his strength. Air drills, wing lifts, all that boring methodical stuff.",
    "We'll just tell Sky that he should practice with Twilight so you won't feel so self-conscious about getting special training from me.",
    "Hah. You say that like it's not gonna be a blast.[montage music][thud]",
    "Oh, you were awesome!",
    "That's the first nice thing I've heard you say about yourself.",
    "Gyuh...[thud]",
    "Do you think they're still mad?[beat]",
    "Yeah, they're still mad.",
    "No, it's ''my'' fault. It hit me when I was watching Sky train with you. He wasn't even trying![Dizzitron whirring][thud]",
    "Oh, no. He's lost his confidence.",
    "Uh, it's a long story, but we'll fix it.",
    "[groans] We really messed up, huh?",
    "You know, you're really good. You're lead pony material.",
    "But you'll never become a Wonderbolt if you're too afraid to shine. That ''is'' what you want, right?",
    "I was hoping you'd say that. Come with me.",
    "Sky, Vapor was never trying to steal your spotlight. She thought she was helping you.",
    "Now, you can either stay mad, or help each other and become two of the greatest flyers the Wonderbolt Academy has ever seen! [beat] Please pick the second option. I don't want Spitfire to be mad at me.[whoosh][wind blowing]",
    "and",
    "[laughing] Okay, let's not get carried away.",
    "Hey, I heard that!",
    "[spine clicking][doors close]",
    "[sighs] You're telling me. Now we can finally catch up with some ''Daring Do'', I can make cider with Applejack\u2014[knocking][door opens]",

    "You go, Fluttershy!",
    "Don't listen to him, Fluttershy! He's just trying to drive a wedge between us like he always does.",
    "So we can't unite and use the Elements of Harmony against you, ''that's'' why!",
    "You big liar!",
    "We'll be outside.",
    "Personally, I think we should come up with a backup plan, in case this whole \"befriending\" business doesn't work out.",
    "Ugh, I can't believe we're having a dinner party with Discord!",
    "That's one ''creepy'' little gravy boat if you ask me.",
    "Hey! That's hot!",
    "He did that on purpose!",
    "I'm not falling for that! Discord's just trying to distract us from\u2013[poking noises]",
    "[grunts] Hey! Knock it off! I suppose that's another \"mistake\"?",
    "Fluttershy! Can't you see what he's doing? He's playing innocent with you so you'll never agree to use the Elements of Harmony against him![splash]",

    "Good thinking. Head on home, put your feet up. I'm sure eventually you'll have the strength to make yourself soup or something...",
    "Not it!",
    "Four more months, four more months, ''four more months''! I bet you're excited, huh?",
    "Come on, you gotta be excited!",
    "I thought so!",
    "Because the next ''Daring Do'' book is coming out exactly four months from today! That's how exciting it is! So what amazing, incredible, awesome adventure do you think Daring Do will have in her next book, huh?",
    "[voice over] Will she at long last stalk the Fortress of Talacon, only to be forced to contend with its dreaded and impenetrable arrow defense? And if so, could her skill, quick wits, and courage possibly carry the day? ''Or'' will her next adventure bring her face to face with the vast and horrible Ahuizotl himself?!",

    "Did they give a reason?",
    "[growls] How could you possibly know that before me? I'm the series' biggest fan!",
    "Oh. Right.",
    "Where she lives?",
    "Don't you get it? The new book is ''obviously'' delayed because she needs help dealing with whatever everyday nonsense is distracting her from spending her every living breathing second writing so I\u2014 I mean, fans like me, can get to read the new book ASAP! Think about it! We could help her with her laundry, buy her groceries, cooking her meals, whatever! Now, who wouldn't appreciate that?",
    "She can always just say no.",
    "Of course I am. So... how's about getting that address?",
    "I think I spotted the house! We're super close! This way!",

    "Yup, I remember that feeling. But not as much as I remember the crushing wave of disappointment that came when things ''didn't'' work out. That right there. ''That'' is the face I do ''not'' want to see.",

    "''What!?'' You couldn't have told her that news ''first''!? That's fifteen minutes from now!",
    "[panicked breathing]",
    "I'll just ignore that. We need to remember that the Games Inspector arriving ''early'' is probably part of a plan to psych us out.",
    "You said it yourself. She's got a rep for trying to catch hosts off-guard, just to see if we can handle the kind of massive pressure that comes with hosting the Equestria Games.",
    "Not if we always stay one step ahead and don't fall for any of her mind games. Anything she throws at us, we just need to remember she's testing us and roll with it.[train braking]",
    "Excuse me, ma'am?",
    "You're letting her lull you into a false sense of confidence. Watch that. It's all part of the game.[twang]",
    "She was probably testing us to see if we could remain in control of a complex situation. Looks like we passed. Bump\u2013",

    "Huh?",
    "I got this. Wanna stretch your legs, huh? Well, whatever you need, I'm sure we can provide. Let's just make our way to the castle's gymnasium. Our tour will now be headed... this way. And we're walking, and we're walking...",
    "Turns out the crystal castle ''doesn't'' have a gymnasium.",
    "Wait, that's the Games Inspector! Let her do her thing.",
    "I have no idea, but that's why she's who's in charge of choosing who gets the Games, and we're not.[crashing][skidding]",

    "Princess, we gave our welcome to the wrong pony, left the right one waiting at the station, and completely ruined everything.",
    "When I was a little filly, I wanted so badly for Cloudsdale to win the Equestria Games. But it didn't happen. So I thought I could make up for that disappointment by helping the Crystal Empire win the chance to host the Games. But it looks like I ruined your chances instead.",
    "We did it!",

    "Wow. You must be slow if all Spike had to do to win was fall down.",
    "Doubt it.",
    "Fine. I'm pretty sure I could beat you anyway. But with that heavy hunk of metal on your back, it'll be a snap.",
    "Otherwise, we'd have brought this shield for nothing.",

    "Okay, that ''was'' pretty good. Quick, we've gotta get out of here and warn Daring Do!",
    "[sighs] Fine. Let's just say this ''is'' a Daring Do Adventucation. The only way to get back to the convention is to go through it. So just follow me, and I'll lead you out. Deal?",
    "[under her breath] Maybe if I just leave you in the jungle, it'll convince you.",
    "Is it too \"realistic\" for you? Wouldn't want ''that'' on a Daring Do adventure, would we?",
    "[straining]",
    "Hah! How's ''that'' for not possible?",
    "Yeah. If you read that in a book, you might even think it was ''unrealistic''.",
    "[straining] You'll never get away with this!",
    "Finally!",
    "Ugh!",
    "Uh... Quibble?",
    "Whoa!",
    "Um, maybe you should let Daring Do figure it out?",
    "Yeah. But... he's usually right.",
    "Uh... The way out is totally covered! How are we gonna get out of here?!",
    "We won't be fast enough! We'll never make it!",
    "If Quibble says go over him, we go over him!",
    "You ''said'' go over him!",
    "He's a fan.",
    "What about you?",
    "So...?",
    "What?! How can you\u2014?!",
    "Okay...?",
    "Well... I-I'm not the one who can locate a treasure in half the time Daring Do can! You may have terrible taste in books, but you're pretty awesome yourself. In a brainy, egghead, puzzle-solving kind of way. Heh.",
    "Definitely friends.",
    "Uh... Quibble?",
    "I'm not nervous at all. When I get into the Wonderbolt Academy...",
    "I'm telling you, it's in the bag.",
    "In Ponyville? I'm probably the best flyer in all of Equestria. I wouldn't be surprised if they just went ahead and made me a Wonderbolt on the first day.",
    "I... didn't get in.",
    "Gotcha! Ha, you guys are so gullible. Like I wasn't gonna get in!",
    "Uh... thanks?",

    "A ''wing''pony?",
    "Permission to enter, ma'am.",
    "''I'' had the best time on the Dizzitron! Only six seconds!",
    "And you made me a wingpony!",
    "Yes, ma'am! I mean no, ma'am! I mean... We'll be an unstoppable team, ma'am.",
    "I think ''I'' should be lead pony, ma'am.",
    "Yes, ma'am.",
    "Ready.",
    "Not yet. Oh! There's one!",
    "We should slow down. It doesn't look like both of us can make it at this speed!",
    "Ow!",
    "Uh, sure. Just give me a second.",
    "Yeah... totally. [groans]",
    "Doesn't matter! We can still fly completely in sync and blow Spitfire's mind with our moves!",
    "Thank you, ma'am. Um, Lightning Dust? Next time, maybe we don't cut the other teams off like that.",
    "Yeah, I-I guess you're right...",
    "But we're already way ahead.",
    "I'm in!",
    "Noooooo!",
    "Are you guys okay?",
    "Pinkie Pie!",
    "Well... yeah, of course I remember you. But... what are you all doing here?",
    "Awesome? My friends could have been smashed to pieces!",
    "A hoof bump? Seriously? You made me clip my wing. You sent half of our class into serious tailspins on the obstacle course. You unleashed a tornado that nearly demolished my friends!",
    "And I ''get'' that you want to be the best. So do I! But you're going about it in the wrong way.",
    "[sigh] You're right. She did.[door opens]",
    "We're done with that, ma'am.",
    "That's why I'm here, ma'am. Lightning Dust decided to use a tornado.",
    "Yeah, well that \"effective tactic\" nearly took out my friends! No disrespect, ma'am, but ''there's a big difference between pushing yourself as hard as you can and just being reckless''. And if being reckless is what gets rewarded around here, if that's what it means to be a Wonderbolt, then I don't want any part of it.",
    "I quit.[door closes]",
    "Not anymore.",
    "OhmygoshOhmygoshOhmygoshOhmygoshOhmygosh!",
    "Yes, ma'am!",
    "Whoa! Twilight?",
    "Must have been \"or something\", because there wasn't any breeze up there.",
    "I'll bet he takes his sweet time.",
    "[muffled] Don't do it, Twilight!",
    "Spit it out!",
    "And once Pinkie and Rarity were saved, whoosh! Me and Fluttershy loop-de-loop around, and WHAM! Caught you right in the nick of time.",

    "Little?",
    "Yeah, right! This has got your cloven hoofprints all over it!",

    "What's gotten into you?! Why do you keep cutting him so much slack?",
    "Wait 'til you get to ''Daring Do and the Riddle of the Sphinx''!",
    "''Fallen Idol''? That's not in the series.",
    "No way Daring Do's biggest fan \u2013 me \u2013 would miss a book coming out! Besides, A. K. Yearling always sends me a copy.",
    "[reading] \"The true story of the thieving fraud known as Daring Do\"?! What?! Why would A. K. Yearling write that about herself?!",
    "Who?",
    "A ''bad'' one. [reading] \"The only thing worse than Daring Do's destruction of temples is her cruelty to the mild-mannered Dr. Caballeron\"?!",
    "More like a disaster! Listen! [reading] \"Daring Do isn't just a fictional character from over-the-top adventure stories. I've met her, and she is a real, live pony!\" That's supposed to be a secret! [grunts] We're the only ones who know Daring Do is really A. K. Yearling in disguise. But if other ponies read this book, how long will it take them to figure that out?! We have to go warn her! ''Fluttershy!''",
    "A. K. Yearling is signing all her books at the bookstore today. We can warn her about what's going on.",
    "Uh, why? The only true thing in that pack of lies is that Daring Do is real.",
    "Are you serious right now? A random writer trashes our friend and exposes her secret, and you want to talk about birds?!",
    "What?!",
    "In order to save precious artifacts from the bad guy, who you seem to have forgotten is Dr. Caballeron! Are you sure you read the same series I did?[door opens]",
    "Well, at least A. K. Yearling's true fans know Martingale's book is bogus.",
    "I... guess we're a little late to warn you about the new book, huh?",
    "No way! He's doing a signing across the street?!",
    "[gasps] That's not Martingale! It's Dr. Caballeron in disguise! Now it all makes sense! Daring Do's archnemesis created a fake author self so he can write books that make him sound like a hero! Who does that?!",
    "This is totally different. [to Dr. Caballeron] Well, well, well! Up to your old tricks again, huh? Just like in Somnambula! Spreading lies to make Daring Do look bad!",
    "[groans] We know who you really are! And unless you want us to tell all of them, you'd better answer some questions!",
    "We aren't gonna let you get away with this, Caballeron!",
    "You mean lying!",
    "[scoffs] That sounds like more of an editor's mistake.",
    "But I don't have to take ''your'' word for it! C'mon, Fluttershy!",
    "Finally! What took you so long?",
    "Say whaaaaaaat?!",
    "[panting] A. K.! You have to help me! Groom Q. Q. Martingale is really Dr. Caballeron, and he has Fluttershy! The book thing was his new plan to ruin Daring Do's reputation, ''and'' he's trying to make my friend a criminal! They're off to Tenochtitlan right now!",
    "That's gotta be why Caballeron tricked Fluttershy into joining his gang!",
    "Fluttershy must be having the worst time with Caballeron's goons!",
    "Why? What's so special about it?",
    "So if this Talisman is so important, why didn't you already save it? You said only a Pegasus can get it, right?",
    "[gulps]",
    "[gasps]",
    "[grunts]",
    "[grunts] We didn't see any cats! We're just here to rescue Fluttershy!",
    "Phew! That was cutting it close.",
    "We're not taking  no for an answer!",
    "Admit it, Caballeron! You're only pretending to like Fluttershy because she has the wings you needed to steal the Truth Talisman! Isn't that right?!",
    "Didn't see that coming.[rumbling]",
    "Or that!",
    "So? How do you get rid of them?![chomp!]",
    "Yeah, I'm not sure how I feel about that.",
    "I'm gonna need the deluxe spa package after this adventure. That doesn't leave this temple!",
    "Uh, did you forget there's a monster out there that wants to crush us?",
    "Or maybe he's just the bad guy! Do I need to remind you he's tried to squash Daring Do like a hundred times?![slam!]",
    "Maybe there ''is'' something to this whole listening-to-everypony thing.",
    "Hey, what's going on? I thought your first co-written novel would bring out a ton of fans.",
    "[grunts, to Twilight] Do we wanna know why you're wrapping up everypony in town?",
    ",",
    "[clears throat] The less shopping, the better. In!",
    "How about Twilight's castle tomorrow night, Hearth's Warming Eve?",
    "Okay, what about your favorite food?",
    "Riiiiight... But there's gotta be something you really, really like.",

    "[groaning]",
    "Candle. Great. Whatever. Fluttershy-shopping done.",
    "Ghost candle![thud]",
    "[groans] What do you want, Discord?[poof]",
    "I tried asking her what she likes, but she likes everything.",
    "I've known her a lot longer than you have.[poof]",
    "[groans] Fine. I'll get her something else.[plane engine roaring]",
    "Whoa![door opens]",
    "Ugh!",
    "Oh, come on!  Fluttershy would ''love'' a spa day!",
    "She's Fluttershy! ''Every''thing makes her worry!",
    "Well, if you're such an expert on Fluttershy, what did ''you'' get her?",
    "Good! Please stop helping me! I'm begging you!",
    "[sarcastically] Great. Still helping.",
    "Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa. You're ''talking'' to the fastest pony in Equestria! If there's some fast animal out there Fluttershy would love, ''I'm'' the one who can get it.",
    "I'm calling it! Dibs!",
    "Guh. Could you try to make less noise?",
    "Winterchilla?",
    "Be super fast?",
    "Uh... I wouldn't have this little fella without you, so... if you wanna join, Fluttershy would love having you. And I wouldn't totally hate it.",

    "Does everypony know this except me?![sparkling sounds]",
    "Can't you do something?!",
    "What?!",
    "They're better than my gift. [sighs] Sorry about the winterzilla.",
    "[stutters, blows] You mean you tricked me into putting my friend in danger on purpose so you\u2014?![winterzilla growls]",
    "Let's just say it was from both of us.",
    "[snorts] [under her breath] Yeah.",
    "[yawns] I gotta admit I'm pretty beat.",
    "So...",
    "Fine! If you want to stand guard, go for it. ''We're'' going to bed.",
    "What happened?",
    "I-I don't even like cake!",
    "I don't have ''pink'' in my mane, ''Pinkie''!",
    "Ow! Cut it out!",
    "Aw nuts, so did I.",
    "And boy was it!",
    "Yeah, I just dove right in!",
    "Sorry, Pinkie.",
    "Hey, Applejack! Whatcha doin'?",
    "Uh, distance bucking? What for?",
    "What?! Ha! That's ridiculous! Nopony beats Ponyville! I mean, I could beat the whole ''town'' of Appleloosa at buckball with one wing tied behind my back![thunk]",
    "[grunts]",
    "Oh, yeah! I am ''so'' there! I've just got one question.",
    "Uh... what's buckball?",
    "So, basically, buckball is the coolest game ever. Offense, defense, teamwork, nonstop action! It's got it all!",
    "Yeah, I'm kind of an expert.",
    "Well, it's a new game. I probably know more than most ponies, so that makes me an expert.",
    "Well, between Applejack and me, we've got two-thirds of a team. All we need is a unicorn. That's where you two come in.",
    "Uh, obviously. You're gonna be on my team, and Fluttershy is gonna be on Applejack's team.",
    "And the Pegasus is on defense. She tries to keep the ball from going in the goal and passes it back to the Earth pony on her team. Just give it a little kick, Pinkie.",
    "All right. Now let's see which of you has what it takes.",
    "When the ball comes towards you, catch it.",
    "Coming your way, Pinkie!",
    "And Fluttershy's spinning tail catch is pretty amazing.",
    "Hiya!",
    "Nope.",
    "No.",
    "No.",
    "Aaaand... no.",
    "[groans] This didn't go how I thought it would.",
    "Hey, Snails, can you float one of those baskets over here?",
    "Well, Snails, with you on the team, Ponyville is one step closer to ''crushing'' Appleloosa!",
    "[laughs] Uh, you two, obviously!",
    "Mm-hmm.",
    "Me, too. I'd normally be so pumped all of Ponyville was counting on me to win, I'd run right over the competition. But you still flew rings around me.",
    "Well, duh! You two are gonna be representing all of Ponyville. And, more importantly, us!",
    "So let's hop to it! Snails already has a head start on you![balls bouncing]",
    "Okay, if you wanna win, you totally gotta get this drill down![knees shaking]",
    "It's all about ball control.",
    "Ready? Go! Come on! Faster! You don't want Ponyville to lose because you can't get into high gear, do you?!",
    "Come on! Push! Push! ''Push!''[clang][circling birdies]",
    "Faster!",
    "Come on!",
    "Come on![bonking]",
    "I don't know. They mopped the field with us before.",
    "Or a whole ''lot'' of it.",
    "Heh. We kinda went around town and talked up the team a little.",
    "Totally! Just spend the whole ride to Appleloosa thinking about everypony cheering for the victorious Ponyville buckball team! [gasps] I bet Princess Celestia even comes to congratulate you! If that doesn't get you in \"the zone\", I don't know what will!",
    "Hey! You two are supposed to be in the zone!",
    "I don't get it. They're naturals! Why wouldn't they want to play anymore?",
    "What?! That's crazy talk! Having ponies depend on you is ''exactly'' what you need to focus! And\u2014",
    "Get ready to totally smash the competition, and\u2014 and... none of that sounds like Pinkie or Fluttershy, does it?",
    "[groans] What do we do now?[knocking][door opens]",
    "Pinkie? Fluttershy?",
    "You don't have to play against Appleloosa.",
    "But... we can't take on Braeburn and his team without any practice. So we need you to play just one more time.",
    "Don't worry about it. Applejack and I just need a little workout.",
    "[panting] No, thanks. Playing against you two is just as humiliating now as it was when we ''weren't'' trying to show you how awesome you are.",
    "I guess some ponies thrive on pressure and some ponies don't. And even though we weren't playing, we were treating you like us, which totally stressed you out.",
    "And having fun is what makes you really, really, really good!",
    "You guys are amazing!",
    "Hah! Good game? We bucked the hooves right off of you!",
    ", and",
    "[over] [grunting]",
    "[sighs] Forget it, Twilight. This door's not opening.",
    "You've been saying how great this place is since we got here!",
    "Not interested! You may have them now, but we're going to get our cutie marks back!",
    "Don't worry. Fluttershy will have us out of here in no time!",
    "This guy's a barrel of laughs.",
    "Come on! Let's go get ''our'' cutie marks!",
    "Look!",
    "Oh, ''come on''![jars rattling]",
    "I can't believe we have to count on these other ponies to save ''our'' cutie marks!",
    "She's gonna get away!",
    "She's getting away!",
    "Come on, Twilight! You can't sit around in the boring dark all day!",
    "What?!",
    "No offense, Twilight, but teaching at that school was the most boring, horrible, awful thing ever.",
    "Totally! Uh... how?",
    "\u2014right now! So, what are you waiting for? Get your student and let's go!",
    "[groans] Do you need me to do the whole apology and explanation thing ''again''? Okay. [inhales]",
    ", and",
    "Ooh! Or went undercover!",
    "[gasps] He must be taking all that stuff to the other students! We've gotta follow him![smack]",
    "Oh, yeah! With class run my way, it'll be ''two hundred'' and twenty percent cooler.",
    "All right team, you're clear for takeoff.",
    "Oh, hey Twilight, what's up?",
    "Sending off one of my flight crews to retrieve the birds that have flown south for the winter.",
    "Um...",
    "Sorry, Twilight.",
    "Got it.",
    "Got it.",
    "Okay.",
    "Ugh! Make up your minds!",
    "Chillax Applejack, we're bustin' our chops as fast as we can.",
    "Oh that featherbrain. Didn't she learn her lesson last year when she went west?[ponies grumble and complain]",
    "I think they have a pretty good idea.",
    "Well, he better get his flank over here then! You have to win the first few games without me cheering you on.",
    "[sighs] Applejack was too busy to come, so she made me promise to go to ''all'' the museum exhibits and tell her about them. I'm gonna try to get in first and beat the crowd so I can get back to the tournament faster.",
    "What?! [grunts] The doors aren't even open yet! What kind of sports fan camps out for a museum?",
    "[gasps] Quibble Pants?",
    "Fancy meeting ''me''? I'm a sportspony. Of course ''I'd'' be here. What's fancy is ''you'' being here. If \"fancy\" meant confusing.",
    "Uh, it's a buckball ''field''. And you ''are''?",
    "Whaaaa...?",
    "Um, you've met Daring Do, so that's probably an exaggeration. [to Clear Sky] No offense.",
    "And who is this?",
    "[chuckles] I kind of wanted to skip the museum, too. ''But'' I promised a friend that I'd check out all the exhibits.",
    "''So''... you and Clear Sky, huh?",
    "What do you mean?",
    "A ball?",
    "It's a basket. How do you not know what these are?",
    "Well, I figured you weren't the sportiest pony in Equestria.",
    "Uh, why?",
    "Here.",
    "Give it a shot. It's easy.",
    "Yeah, I don't think she's fooled.",
    "Ha! No problem. I've totally got your flank.",
    "[to Wind Sprint] Trust me, the game's a ''lot'' harder to play with apples.",
    "Who do you think taught them? Of course, being a Wonderbolt takes up most of my time, so I don't get to practice as much as I'd like.",
    "Hmm, you don't say. You know, Quibble's pretty sporty, too.",
    "I think I've seen enough of this museum for ''three'' Applejacks. Let's go watch some buckball!",
    "Uh, do you mean \"ball park\"?",
    "Of course she will. She just needs to see your sporty side.",
    "''Every''pony has a sporty side, and we're gonna find yours. By the end of the day, I am gonna turn you into the sportiest pony in Equestria!",
    "It's either that or be yourself and bond with Wind over comic books and role-playing games.",
    "What?! Wow. We need to get started on \"Operation Sportify\" ASAP.",
    "To figure out what your sporty side is, we just need to see what your skills are. Everypony's got something. Speed![zooming]",
    "Strength!",
    "Agility! Heh. Of course, some ponies can do it all.",
    "Right. We should probably start small. I'll pass the ball to you, and you just pass it back to me, okay?",
    "Okay. Maybe agility's not your thing.",
    "Ready?",
    "Yep.",
    "Remember, think speed.",
    "On your marks, get set...",
    "Go! [blows whistle]",
    "Come on, Quibble. You got this!",
    "If we had time to train, I know I could mold you into the perfect sportspony. [groans] Or at least a ''sportier'' pony.",
    "Maybe you're not the best athlete in Equestria, or the most coordinated, or the fastest, or... even a little bit strong.",
    "''But'' none of that matters because I just figured out how to sportify you![action theme][whistle blows][crowd cheering]",
    "Well, you can thank Quibble. Wonderbolts, buckball stars... He's friends with the sportiest ponies around, so he must be pretty sporty, too, right?",
    "I guess you'll find out.",
    "I think it's time we told Wind about your next surprise.",
    "A \u2013 books are awesome. And B \u2013 this is way more awesomer than that! For the tournament halftime show, you and Quibble are gonna play a game of buckball against Team Ponyville!",
    "Uh, you should probably stretch.",
    "Look, you wanted to impress Wind Sprint, and this just made sense.",
    "Don't worry, I've got your flank. I already talked to Pinkie Pie and Fluttershy. They're ''totally'' gonna make you look good.",
    "Yeah, I'm pretty sure everypony knows you're not supposed to score in the other team's goal.",
    "What are you doing out here?",
    "Come on. That goal you scored for the other team was amazing.",
    "What?! We haven't even gotten started! I've got, like, seven more top-notch ideas to turn you into a super-sporty pony!",
    "It's \"throw ''in'' the towel\". And that's ridiculous! You can't just give up!",
    "It's \"beating her to the ''punch''\", and it's barely a sports reference. How do you not know that?",
    "So you should stop pretending! Look, you are ''terrible'' at sports. You're uncoordinated, slow, weak\u2014",
    "And you're completely clueless about anything having to do with athletics. But maybe ''I'm'' not the pony you should've come to for help.",
    "Say wha\u2014? [nervous laugh] Wha...?! Hah! Nah!",
    "Technically, he still needed to buy her the book, but that's it.",
    "I'm not gonna move. ''You'' move.",
    "and",
    "But then we'll never find out who the Most Daring Pony is!",
    "You can't be tied for the ''Most'' Daring Pony!",
    "Okay, no problem. We just have to come up with ''another'' daring dare.",
    "Uh, what's so daring about this place? This is where we got the Elements of Harmony.",
    "You mean, like a ghost?",
    "Ugh.",
    "I don't see what's so daring about an old legend. Plus, I don't believe in ghosts.",
    "''Run''![clattering and shuffling]",
    "[panting] Okay, so, ''maybe'' the legend is true!",
    "Scared? I'm not scared!",
    "Then it's settled! Whoever stays in the castle the longest is the Most Daring Pony.",
    "But it's gonna take a lot more than some shadowy ghost pony to get ''me'' to leave.",
    "I sure hope you're not afraid of the dark, Applejack!",
    "I dunno how all that math works because I'm not scared at all!",
    "W-what's the matter? It's just a dark hallway full of... disembodied pony legs.",
    "Applejack, if you're scared, you can just admit it. You don't need to put your hoof around me.",
    "[scream]",
    "and",
    "You mean, the creepy sound of a haunted pipe organ?",
    "[worried] I don't know what you're talking about![organ music, whinny]",
    "Whoa! [nervous laughter] It's just old pony armor. What's the big deal?",
    "[screams][organ chord]",
    "Uh... Applejack? If you went back to Ponyville, that means I win, right?[rattle, crash]",
    "[screaming]",
    "Haunted statues, creepy armor... Come on, castle! Is that all you got?[thunder]",
    ", and",
    "[screaming]",
    "[screaming]",
    "Fluttershy? What are you doing here?",
    "On whether or not ''you're'' the Pony of Shadows.",
    "''You're'' the Pony of Shadows?",

    "Yeah, I said it, but I was wrong! I did want that book, a lot. I said I wanted it more than anything in all of Equestria. But there's no thing that's worth as much to me as a friend. I might have forgotten that for a little bit, but it's true. Which means there's no way this trade can be fair!",
    "Oh, come on! You both gave up what you wanted to get something for each other! That's the coolest thing a friend can do. Trust me, I know.",

    "Oh, but I...! [stutters, sighs] You're right. I guess I should've just eaten the pies in the first place. [gasps] Wait! That's it! I know how I can make it up to her!",
    "Pinkie Pie, wait! I know now that I should've been honest with you from the start, because lying to your friends is wrong. And because getting rid of all those pies was a giant hassle. I mean, do you have any idea how many pies you've made for me over the years?",
    "Of course you do. The point is I thought the hassle was worth it just to spare your feelings, but I was wrong. So to make up for it, I made this pie for you. Well, I guess I made it for me. To eat in front of you. Point is I'm eating this pie for friendship!",
    "Yeah! I know I can't go back and eat all the pies you made for me in the past, so instead I'm going to eat this one giant one for you now. So here I go.[splat][splat]",

    "[to her reflections] Hey there, Fluttershys! Any ideas on how to Discord up this tea party? [higher-pitched] Hi, Fluttershy! Thanks for asking! First of all, you gotta redecorate this place.

    "I wouldn't expect you to throw a tea party the way I would. We're different!",
    "What?! Why would you ever think that?",

    "Goodness, no! I couldn't be out tonight. I just couldn't.",
    "Oh. I guess that is true.",
    "You think so?",
    "Hi, everypony.",
    "Everything is fine. In fact, it's ''more'' than fine. I've decided to join you in your Nightmare Night festivities.",
    "Every Nightmare Night, I shut myself in my cottage and refuse to come out until morning. But it's just like when I was afraid to sing in front of anypony. If I hadn't given it a try, I never would've found out how much I enjoy it.",
    "Oh, right. The maze.",
    "Oh, I am! I am ready to take on Nightmare Night!",
    "[shuddering] [giggles] Just practicing. [nervous laugh]",
    "What if we encounter something terrifying and need to get away quickly? All those layers could slow me down, or worse, make me trip!",
    "A mask?",
    "They can just be so difficult to see out of.",
    "W-What about being able to see what's to the left or right of me?",
    "What if I just wear the dress?",
    "I'm wearing it.",
    "Close. I'm going to a masquerade ball. Without the mask.[bonk]",
    "Well, um, it's just that if I'm blindfolded and somepony were to leap out in front of me, I'd never have the chance to defend myself.",
    "[gulps]",
    "It's just that, um... What happens if, when my head is deep down in the water, some kind of scary monster appears? How would I even hear to know I was under attack?[beat]",
    "It is?",
    "Well, it's just... What if when I'm eating one of these chewy taffies, my mouth becomes glued shut and I can't scream for help?[beat]",
    "Oh, goodness. We've only just started to celebrate Nightmare Night together, and I'm already taking all the fun out of it, aren't I?",
    "I really wanna do this. But there's just so many things that terrify me about tonight. I couldn't possibly predict what might upset me.",
    "Then I can help you all have fun and I can still be a part of Nightmare Night!",
    "I think I do! And I don't want to get ahead of myself, but I think I have the ''perfect'' idea for how I'm gonna do it!",
    "[spooky voice] Meet me at my cottage in an hour. [normal voice] Oh, I'm excited to see everypony soon![knocking at door][door creaks]",
    "[spooky voice] Welcome to Fluttershy's tea party!",
    "[spooky voice] Have a seat. Don't be scared of what awaits you. Go on. Pass the sugar. Oh, no! There ''is'' none! You're a terrible host! Rarity, put your coat on!",
    "[spooky voice] You need to cover up because no one has complimented your dressssssss! Pinkie Pie, look to your left and ask your best friend to pass the cucumber sandwiches!",
    "[spooky voice] That's right. Because she didn't care to show uuuuuup.",
    "[spooky voice] A friend who didn't come through. That must scare you to the coooore. Quick, everypony, look behind you!",
    "[spooky voice] They're unplanned guests. Your woooorst nightmare. You don't have enough food for them! Oh, no! There's a tiny kitten that needs a home! But you are over-scheduled right now. You don't have time to help! I said, \"You don't have time to help!\" This should appear to scare you! [normal voice] Why don't you look terrified? You showed up to a party and everypony was extremely disappointed in you. Can you imagine anything more upsetting?",
    "Oh, I'm just not cut out for this. Just go on without me.",
    "You ''have'' to. This is the night you look forward to all year.",
    "It's okay. I really want you all to have fun. This is how I spend ''every'' Nightmare Night. Please go. I'll be fine.",
    "I ''did'' try my hardest.",
    "Or... maybe not. I suppose I ''could'' have gone with something a bit scarier. You're right! I've been taking baby steps! I think it's time for grown up ones! I don't suppose you have any ideas how I could do that?",
    "Oh, my! I'm so, so sorry. Can you ever forgive me?",
    "After you left, I realized that I wasn't ready to give up on Nightmare Night. So I asked Granny Smith if I could try to make the maze even scarier for my friends.",
    "I had some help. Angel was the scary figure that kept scurrying after you in the maze. Fuzzy Legs made the sticky wall that made it difficult for you to see and move. And, of course, Harry was the especially scary monster.",
    "We ''could'' celebrate Nightmare Night together every year. But the truth is I really don't want to.",
    "Yes, but I've also realized something. You all may love Nightmare Night and I may be good at being a part of it, but it's no fun for me to see my friends feel like they're in danger, even if I know they're not. I really don't like it. It's just not my cup of tea.",
    "No. Just regular tea. We do lots of fun things together, but I'm afraid this just isn't gonna be one of them. Actually, I'm ''not'' afraid. I'm perfectly fine with it.",
    "[sighs] I don't know why I doubted myself for a second. Now ''this'' is what I call a perfect Nightmare Night.[credits]{{Transcripts}}[[esTranscripciones/Enfrentando el Temor]][[ptTranscri\u00e7\u00f5es/Mestra do Susto]]{{Infobox Transcript}}[birds chirping][ducks quacking]",

    "Oh, dear.[nail clippers clipping]",
    "They ''do'' seem to have made themselves right at home here.",
    "Don't be silly, Dr. Fauna. You're the best vet pony in Equestria. At least that's what I've been telling everypony.",
    "Oh, no. Do you suppose it's my fault? I'm so sorry. I didn't mean for this to happen. I just know animals feel safe and happy under your care.[ducklings chirping]",
    "That ''is'' a big problem... that I'm going to fix for you! I already have the perfect solution that'll make the critters happy ''and'' give you more space. Then you'll have all your ducks in a row!",

    "I want to thank you all for rushing right over when I called.[squirrel chittering]",
    "Dr. Fauna needs my help with a serious problem.",
    "No. Her vet clinic is a bit... maybe, um... overrun with adorable critters in dire need of a safe place to lay their heads, and... they don't have anywhere to go!",
    "I know!",
    "Oh, that's great news! Because it means you'll all be helping me with something special, too. Something that's been a dream of mine for a long time.",
    "Um, no. Not exactly.",
    "My dream is to build a real animal sanctuary.[bird chirps]",
    "A beautiful habitat where every animal \u2013 whether sick or scared or even just lonely, feathered or furry, scaly or slimy \u2013 every critter would be welcome. My sanctuary can be the one place in Equestria they call home 'til they feel ready to take on the world.[animals cheering]",
    "Oh, thank you, everypony. You all taught me so much about building my confidence over the years. It's because of your friendship that I finally feel able to make my dream project a reality. But I can't build the sanctuary alone. Will you join me?",
    "How lovely!",
    "Is it you, Rarity?",
    "Wow, everypony! Thank you! I can't wait to meet all of them and hear their ideas. We're right on track to building the most wonderful sanctuary in Equestria!",
    "Thank you, Rupert. Ahem. It's wonderful that you all could join me to discuss the Ponyville sanctuary project. My friends have so many nice things to say about each of your talents. This is a big project, so I'm happy to have such experienced ponies working on it with me.",
    "I-I think so.",
    "Of course.",
    "Um, not exactly. It's more of a dream board.",
    "Well, that's because it's not. It's a ''sanctuary''. A place that is safe but not restrictive. Cozy but natural. A place where the animals can come and go as they please.[mouse squeaking]",
    "So, can you build it?",
    "I want the sanctuary to have an open floor plan. No walls. More like an enclosure that ''melts'' into the trees. With a gate in the back. That way, the animals can return to the forest right when they feel ready.",
    "But I don't want to clear the trees. I want to ''use'' them.",
    "Critters don't live the same way ponies do. I know this is unconventional, but that's because we're trying to do something that's never been done before. I really believe it'll work.[birds chirping]",
    "Good.",
    "Um, not to be rude, but there must be some mistake. We have no need for curtains at the sanctuary.",
    "Everything is gonna look natural in the animal habitats, not like it was made for ponies.",
    "Drab? You're calling the colors of beautiful trees drab?",
    "I appreciate your input, but I just know the animals would be happiest with dirt brown pillows and leaf green accents.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Hmm.",
    "I'm looking for something less like a cage and more like a nice hug. Maybe if we lose that part.",
    "Exactly! Ooh! This is the perfect base for a little nest. I'll take a bunch of these and anything else the animals can burrow into.",
    "No! No cages. I want to give the animals the freedom to come and go. It's the only way they'll feel comfortable.",
    "[gasps]",
    "I... I... [angry] I ''don't'' love it! This is ''not'' going to work at all! A giraffe can't fit through this door! With these curtains blocking the light, how are the birds gonna sing in the sunshine? And ''this'' is the ''opposite'' of a nice hug! I know you all worked hard, but ''none'' of you did anything I asked for!",
    "I may not know much about construction or interior design or wrangling, but I ''am'' an expert at one thing the care of animals! And what animals need is a sanctuary, not ''this''!",
    "My vision isn't the problem here! I told you all exactly what I wanted, and none of you listened to me! So while I appreciate your efforts, I no longer require your services!",
    "Oh, um, actually, it's, uh, not ready and... [gasps][bonk][raccoon family chittering][rip][woodpecker pecking][goat bleating][cage closes][bear growls]",

    "No. ''I'm'' the one who should be sorry. This didn't go at all like I had imagined.[sweet music playing]",
    "Sleep tight, little one. It's going to be okay. I promise.[mice squeaking]",
    "Now, now, every mouse has gotta wait their turn.[mice squeaking]",
    "[sighs] I'm so sorry. I thought I'd have a beautiful sanctuary for you all to stay in by now. But I put my trust in the wrong ponies.",
    "''No!''[bear groans]",
    "I won't give up! These animals need me! And I'm gonna solve this once and for all! If this little lady can crawl all the way here from Western Equestria, ''I'' can find a way to build her a safe place to rest![animals cheering]",
    "Oh! [joins in laughter] Oops. Everyone back to sleep now.",
    "Thanks for coming, everypony. As you know, building the sanctuary didn't go quite as planned.",
    "It's okay. You were all just trying to help. But I know that letting all the experts go was the right call.",
    "Try again. I'm going to rebuild the sanctuary and do it ''my'' way this time.",
    "Everypony, ''stop!'' I appreciate you sharing your thoughts, but I need everypony to respect mine. Other ponies may be experts in ''their'' fields, but animals are ''my'' field of expertise. And if I say this is what I want, then this is what needs to happen! Oh, um, for the animals of course.",
    "To get things back on track, I called in a favor from an old friend. He'll be here any minute.",
    "This is one expert I know I can trust to put the animals first. Plus there's nopony better at building.[knock on door][door opens]",
    "And he certainly knows his stuff when it comes to buildings ''and'' caring for animals.",
    "Are you ready?",
    "Okay, you can open your eyes! Welcome to Sweet Feather Sanctuary, a safe and cozy retreat for everycreature!",
    "Now you should have plenty of room at the clinic. Because once you've treated them, they can recover here! With my help, of course. It's okay, Lola. We all move at our own pace. Sometimes, all we need to do is believe in our dreams. And when we finally reach our goal, we'll know that it was worth what it took to get there, because the view will be even better than you imagined![credits]{{Transcripts}}[[ru\u0421\u0442\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043c\u043c\u044b/\u0424\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0448\u0430\u0439 \u0432\u044b\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u0443\u0442\u044c]]{{Infobox Transcript}}",

    "Okay, we all agree the castle is too cluttered, right? So why doesn't everypony take ''one'' of their own decorations out and we'll see how it looks?",
    "Come on, Rarity. Everypony has taken somethin' out except you.",
    "Okay, everypony calm down. I'm sure we can find a way to remove the clutter ''together''.",

    "Calm down, Pinkie. We just need to figure out what we did wrong so we can make it right.",
    "Come on, y'all. We just need to think about Twilight. What was it she'd loved about livin' in the Golden Oak Library?",
    "Yeah, for you, maybe.",
    "We had a lot of good memories there, though. That's what made the Golden Oak Library home.",
    "[gasps] That's it!",
    "[sighs] Maybe my plan won't work after all.",
    "What really makes home feel like home isn't what it looks like. It's the memories you make when you're there.",
    "And the best part of it is, it's made from the roots of the Golden Oak Library, so you'll never forget where you came from.",
    "Truth be told... I couldn't either. Your kitchen might have some rustic farm decor, Twilight.",

    "Shucks, Twilight! Y'all done it up nice and cozy in here.",
    "Oh, that's mighty sweet of you, but we're just stoppin' in to wish y'all a happy Hearth's Warmin' before we go.",
    "That's us. See you later!",
    "But tonight is Hearth's Warming ''Eve''. Everypony knows you don't open presents 'til tomorrow.",
    "That's not how our family does it, and I reckon it can't be how Pinkie's does it. Is it?",
    "It's so excitin'! Related or not, it's gonna be a hoot havin' our families together under one roof!",
    "Friends ''or'' family, this here's about togetherness.",
    "Now hang on, sugarcube. You know Hearth's Warmin' isn't ''just'' about candy and presents, right?",
    "'Fraid so! [clears throat] A long time ago, the Earth ponies, Pegasus ponies, and unicorn ponies weren't friends.",
    "But then, the icy chill of the Windigos almost iced up everythin'. So the ponies decided to work together, and their friendship drove them nasty critters away.",
    "Triumphant, they raised a new flag to celebrate all three tribes, and Equestria was born.[biting sound]",
    "Uh, what happened to the flag?",
    "Mm-hmm! And tonight, we'll have the traditional Hearth's Warmin' Eve dinner to remember the shared bounties of our ancestors.",
    "Then we'll hang our Hearth's Warmin' dolls over the fireplace to remind us of the warmth shared on that fateful night.",
    "And tomorrow, we open presents!",

    "[hushed] So far, so good, ''cousin''!",
    "Well, that's a mighty tall order, but it wouldn't surprise me in the least.",
    "What about hot rolls and mulled cider and double-baked pot pie?",
    "Yeah, um, you know what? This ''is'' what we were expectin'! Right, everypony?",
    "[laughs nervously]",
    "O' course, I'm just being a rusty fiddle. Tune me up and let's get back to dinner. [slurping] [gag, coughs]",
    "Now that's somethin' I know all about![picking noises]",
    "Are you sayin' that ''rock'' is a Hearth's Warmin' doll?",

    "The what findin' what now?",
    "So now that we're all split up, mind tellin' us what we're doin'?",
    "You mean on the flagpole?",
    "Traditionally, it's the youngest\u2014",
    "Pinkie Pie, will you please tell us what's goin' on?",
    "[yelps]",
    "I still don't understand.",
    "It's all just so... complicated, and... rock-based.",
    "I don't know. I sure hope everypony else is havin' a better time.",
    "A ''picture''? I've been lookin' for a ''real'' stone, Pinkie Pie!",
    "Y'all ''hide'' your presents?",
    "So ''nopony'' gets presents?",
    "So lemme get all this straight. You're only allowed to eat rock soup for dinner, then the pony who finds this rock gets to raise the flag, but not really 'cause you don't got no flagpole, and to top it off, you don't even get presents?!",
    "Well, how 'bout you picture this? Both our families, openin' presents, raisin' the flag...?",
    "Goodnight, Pinkie Pie! [hushed] We've gotta ''do'' somethin', y'all! Pinkie Pie's family never had a real Hearth's Warmin'!",
    "Well, I-I'm sure it's what she meant.",
    "[sighs] I know they have their traditions and we have ours, but I just want them to see how much ''better'' theirs could be.[rooster crows]",
    "It's Hearth's Warmin', Apple-style! We've been doin' everythin' your way, I thought we could mix it up a bit! Marble Pie, you could raise the Equestria flag up this pole, because you're the youngest Pie! Ma and Pa Pie, we'll cook you up a meal you'll never forget! And look, we all get presents without havin' to find 'em!",
    "I didn't mean to cause a fuss... Why don't we just open presents around the flag pole? It'll be fun, you'll see!",
    "Oh, boy.[bell ringing]",
    "[sniffling] I really cracked the corn this time.",
    "Pinkie Pie?",
    "What are ''you'' doin' here?",
    "and",
    "I'm too ashamed to go back up there. Your family, my family, they all must think I'm such a nincompoop.",
    "I'm sorry I forced my traditions over yours. I don't want you to have to choose between the family you were born into and the friends who love you like one. I really hoped we could be one big happy family. I guess not.",
    "I wish I could stay, but I have a train to catch.",
    "[tearing up] You too.[train noises]",
    "Aw, crickets! That ''is'' important! I got so caught up in the things they were doin', I never asked why they did 'em![smack]",
    "[reading] ''To Applejack, from Pinkie Pie. Cousins forever.''",
    "[laughing] Only Pinkie Pie could hide a present on a movin' train. ...What a great tradition. [beat] Stop the train!",
    "Need a little help?",
    "I wasn't tryin' to take your traditions away, I was tryin' to share ours. I was so focused on us bein' one big happy family, I thought we needed the same traditions right away. What I should've done was learn about yours and teach you about ours. And over time, we'd make new traditions together. I'm sorry, y'all.[beat]",
    "Happy Hearth's Warmin', Pinkie Pie.",
    "And I packed you a basket of nice fresh apples in case you get hungry.",
    "What could you be nervous about, Twilight? Cadance just loves you to pieces!",
    "I'm guessin' you've got a plan that'll keep it that way.",
    "Yup, definitely sounds like you two will have some real quality time together.",

    "[hushed] That joker's up to something, and whatever it is, we're gonna keep it as far away from Twilight and Princess Cadance as possible.[ECG beeping]",
    "Maybe.",
    "They're plenty close.",

    "I don't wanna go sayin' you got what you deserved...",
    "I came to invite you personally, but it seems you were a speck too busy reading the last ''Daring Do'' book for the ''twelfth time''.",
    "Hoo-wee, somepony really trashed this place.",
    "We didn't do this, Ms. Yearling\u2014 whoa!",
    "Amazing!",
    "We can't go back now! Looks a mite like she needs our help more than ever!",
    "This don't sound like you.",
    "Drop the ring, Ahui... whatever your name is!",
    "Well, it turns out doin' up a concert's the same as settin' up a rodeo.",
    "Sapphire Shores?",
    "Who in the hay is Countess Coloratura?",
    "Pinkie Pie, who is this Countess Coloratura pony?",
    "Don't know. Though I did know a gal named Coloratura when I was just a filly. [laughs and snorts] Wouldn't it just be the funniest thing if ''that'' Coloratura and ''this'' Coloratura were the same Coloratura? Heh.",
    "Well, I don't think it's the same pony, since my friend wasn't any sort of high-falutin' countess.",
    "Sure do. It had this super colorful bunch of musical notes that just shimmered in the light.",
    "Well, fancy that! That there's the very same cutie mark!",
    "Nah.",
    "This was clearly some sort of misunderstandin', 'cause Rara was just as down home as me!",
    "Even that big name was too fancy for her, so I shortened Colo''ra''tu''ra'' to \"Rara\"![foals shouting]",
    "[voiceover] We had the best time at Camp Friendship![splat]",
    "[voiceover] Rara was just so easygoin'! We were like two apples from the same branch.[splashing]",

    "[voiceover] After camp, we wrote to each other for a bit, but...",
    "...then we lost touch. But Rara always did want to go to Manehattan to try and make it big. But a demandin' diva? Just you wait, Pinkie. Once Rara gets here, you'll see she's just a plain old pony like you and me.",
    "Really?[pop music BGM][rumbling and clanking]",
    "Rara?",
    "No... that can't be her. [clears throat] Um... hi. Remember me? We met at Camp Friendship? I gave you the nickname \"Rara\"?",
    "Yeah! Heh. Howdy, Rara!",
    "Yeah... real special.",
    "Pinkie's right, Rarity! The Rara I knew didn't hide behind a veil givin' out fake stamp kisses, sippin' up imported water, and needin' her cherries separated.",
    "She's become a whole other pony!",
    "Rarity was right! I ''don't'' believe it!",
    "Correct me if I'm wrong here, but that feller isn't actually complimentin' Rara. He's complimentin' all the bells and whistles he's piled on to make her Countess Coloratura.",
    "If you ask me, that wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing.",
    "The schoolponies'll be so happy to hear that, Rara!",
    "Now ''that's'' more like the Rara ''I'' remember.",
    "I heard, Pinkie. But don't you fret. I'll talk to Rara and fix things right up.",
    "Alright now, you'd best get along, little ponies.",
    "Uh... Hey, Rara, you mind if I talk to you about your manager?",
    "Well, while you were meetin' with the schoolponies, he was demandin' all sorts of stuff from Pinkie Pie.",
    "Well, do you see somethin' wrong with him tellin' Pinkie that if she doesn't get those things by tomorrow, he'd pull you from our charity festival?",
    "I'm afraid ''Svengallop'' doesn't give a pickled pippin about your charity work.",
    "Jealous of what? A pony who hides behind a veil so thick she can't see when somepony's usin' her? No, I'm not jealous of that, Rara!",
    "It just ain't right! He's manipulatin' her, and she's just not seein' it!",
    "Sorry, Pinkie, but there is no way I'm lettin' that lousy Svengallop use my friend like that!",
    "Countess Coloratura!",
    "I said your ''new'' name, but I saw the real you hangin' out with those schoolponies yesterday. And I know somepony that'd prefer if you stop doin' those little events.",
    "Come on now. You've just got to give me a chance to prove what I'm sayin' is true.",
    "Do exactly what I say. We'll see if that Svengallop truly has your best interests at heart.",
    "Oh, Rara, I'm so sorry. Are you gonna be okay for the concert tonight?",
    "Can you give us a minute, Rarity?",
    "Now, why's it gonna be so terrible?",
    "Now, now, don't go gettin' yourself into a tizzy there, Rara. Svengallop turned you into Countess Coloratura and acted like your friend so he could enjoy the perks that came with bein' a star. But the ''real'' perk of friendship is gettin' to see your friend bein' true to their self. And Rara, when you're simply yourself, you're the brightest star I've ever seen shine.[crowd cheering]",
    "Thank you kindly, Twilight, for helping me out. I bet Big McIntosh I could get all these Golden Delicious in the barn by lunchtime. If I win, he's gonna walk down Stirrup Street in one of Granny's girdles. [chuckles]",
    "''Nice''? It's a heap good more than just nice. I'd love to go. Land sakes...",
    "If I had an apple stand set up, ponies would be chowin' our tasty vittles 'til the cows came home. Do you have any idea how much business I could drum up for Sweet Apple Acres? Why, with all that money, we could do a heap of fixin' up 'round here. We could replace that saggy old roof, and Big McIntosh could replace that saggy old plow, and Granny Smith could replace that saggy old hip.",

    "Is that a yes?",
    "So, that's a maybe?",
    "Twilight, sugar, I didn't mean to put so much pressure on you, and if it helps, I don't want the ticket anymore. You can give it to somepony else. I won't feel bad, I promise.",

    "[gulp]",
    "Uh-huh. Why don't you just scooch on over there, Granny? Think I'll take it from here on out.",

    "That is mighty generous of you, but I think you've done enough for one day.",

    "Exactly! So I think we can all agree that from here on out, I should be in charge of everythin'.",

    "[hushed] Easy, Pinkie, let's play this safe! We got her in a good mood, so let's not do anything to ruin that.",

    "Luckily, she's got a whole bushel o' helpers right here.",
    "Twilight, we've been studyin' and referencin' and cross-referencin' for three days straight now.",
    "It'd take a whole team of ponies to clear away all this brush.[rock clatters]",
    "Which was what?",
    "They did what now?",
    "So they got stuck, too!",
    "But you'd be savin' ''all'' the Pillars, right? A-And they disappeared ages ago.",
    "Rockhoof's shovel!",
    "Oh, I can guarantee Rockhoof was as real as you and me.",
    "Probably.",

    "I bet if you told somepony else the story, it might sound... [gasps] \"preposterous\".",
    "I hope you don't think you're the only one to find her artifact, because this here shovel says otherwise.",

    "There's the zap apple leaves, right on schedule!",
    "I'm sorry, Apple Bloom. I already told you that we just can't take a break from harvest to come to your school. You know what'll happen.",
    "I'm sorry, Apple Bloom, but don't you fret. Granny Smith's got no shortage of entertainin' stories to tell.",
    "The zap apple harvest has begun![thud]",
    "So I take it Family Appreciation Day went well?",
    "Who wants to help Granny sing to the water?",
    "and",
    "Uh... which is the salad and which is the appetizer again? And which am I supposed to eat first? Oh, never mind. I'm not hungry.",
    "Phew! Now I can eat someth'n! I'm starved! Oh...",
    "What in tarnation?!",
    "You packed bug spray?",
    "Yup. Looks like we're all set then.[cart trundling]",
    "Gee, Rarity, did you remember to pack?",
    "Well, looks like we're all set ''now''.",
    "'Course she is, sugarcube. She's gonna meet us up at our first campsite.",
    "Alright, y'all, let's move 'em out!",
    "The last thousand times you asked that, the answer was no. This time, it's actually yes. There's Rainbow Dash up there right now.[crunch][thump][splash]",
    "Well, ''some'' of us didn't pack as light as the others. So we were slowed down a bit.[hammering]",
    "[yawns] Think it's about time for me to hit the straw.",
    "Don't you worry, little sis. There's no 'Olden Pony' in our tent.",
    "I don't care if that cart's as heavy as a pack of mules. If we don't get a move on, it'll be dark before we get to the campsite!",
    "You're more nervous than a worm in an apple on cider making day. What gives, Scootaloo?",
    "You sure you're okay? You seem a little jumpy.",
    "No need for tents tonight, y'all. We'll just take shelter in that cave.",
    "Bbbbrrr! Hoo-wee! It's colder than a timberwolf's toenail. Bbbrr! Where's that Scootaloo?",
    "It's all we need. Why don't you sit with Rainbow Dash for a while?[fire starts]",
    "If it doesn't have a head, then how in tarnation does this pony know where it's goin'?",
    "So where's its brain?",
    "'Fraid so, Scootaloo.",
    "Good night, y'all.",

    "Yeah. Good luck, Dash.",
    "Well we can't wait to hear all about it!",
    "So you started off on the wrong hoof. I'll bet every new Wonderbolt has a tough first day.",

    "Heh. Except maybe cotton candy.[engines roaring]",
    "Uh, Twilight? Why are you hanging out in a ditch?",
    "[gasp] Twitchy tail? Pinkie Sense? Whoa! Nyu-uh!",
    "I know it doesn't make much sense, but those of us who have been in Ponyville a while have learned over time that, if Pinkie's a-twichin', you better listen.",
    "Twilight! You came to visit my new apple cellar, how nice. Twi? You okay? Uh, Twi?",
    "Takin' more apples to my new apple cellar. How 'bout you, Pinkie? Whatchu doin'?",
    "[gasp] That's where Fluttershy's headed!",
    "We better go and make sure she's okay.",
    "I hope nothin'.",
    "I'm tryin' not to think about it.",

    "Phew, what a relief.",
    "Um... Twilight?",
    "Who cares? ''Run''![ponies screaming]",
    "[grunt]",
    "What are you talking about, Pink?",
    "[whinnies in surprise]",
    "[whispering] Uh, Rainbow Dash? We're supposed to be actin' like nothing's wrong.",
    "[hushed] What I mean is, maybe you should let ''me'' keep the Crystal Ponies away from the fake Heart, while ''you'' show off your joustin' skills.",
    "How are y'all feelin'? Havin' a good time?",
    "Well, that's good! Gotta renew that spirit of love and unity if you're gonna power up that Crystal Heart, right?",
    "Oh, I hear ya, but, uh... phew! Gettin' a little toasty out here. Bet you'd like to cool off with a little Crystal Empire nectar! Uh, you tried the Crystal Empire fritters yet? Made from a traditional Crystal Empire recipe! You're gonna love 'em! [loudly] Uh, I hear there's a joustin' match about to start! You don't wanna miss that! [hushed] Come on, Twilight... These Crystal Ponies are more curious than a cat!",
    "We gotta do everything we can to keep this thing goin'. The Princess isn't lookin' so good. I can't imagine her magic is gonna last much longer. It's gonna be fine. These ponies are gonna power up that Crystal Heart when the time comes, and we won't be needin' her magic anyway.",
    "On its way!",
    "Oops.",
    "Now, don't y'all worry your pretty little Crystal heads! The real Crystal Heart will be here any second!",
    "[hushed] Don't know if ''I'' believe me...[electricity crackling]",
    "But... good things are better when they're a ''rarity''.",
    "It doesn't look like you're in much shape to do anything.",
    "Why in Equestria would you be glad to hear that?",
    "Mm-hmm.",
    "Well, I'm mighty flattered you wanna work with your big sis on your cart. I mean, the Applewood Derby did\u2014",
    "Well, I couldn't be more proud to help my little sister take the prize for most traditional.",
    "[scoffs] Fastest? Apple Bloom, things aren't like they were in the old days. The fastest cart now has gotta be slick and modern and\u2014",
    "Not Apple at all. The Apples win most traditional. We have since the Derby started! Why would anypony want to win anythin' else? Now why don't you head off and get some chamomile vines, some hickory sticks, and some apple barrels, and I'll show you what an Apple family cart should look like!",
    "Oh, apples, quit complainin'! In my day, we were up even earlier!",
    "And my cart wins most traditional! Hoo-wee, it's gonna be a good day!",
    "Yup.",
    "You can feast your eyes on... this! I-I mean, it ain't quite finished yet.",
    "But don't it have the makin's of the best cart you ever did see? Uh... is somethin' wrong, Apple Bloom?",
    "Bless my hooves, I thought we covered this! Tradition is all that counts! And who knows tradition better than Apples? Nopony, that's who! So are you an Apple, or are you an Apple? [snorts]",
    "No, not the fringe![crash]",
    "Ugh! Why, shoot! Now I've gotta start all over from scratch, and it's almost race time!",
    "No time! And who'd want to redesign somethin' that's already perfect?",
    "Whoa, ponies! Wait for me! This traditional cart handles at the exact perfect pace \u2013 slow! And I got the passenger seat all warmed up for ya, Apple Bloom!",
    "They'll be along.",
    "Faster? Don't be silly. This is perfect!",
    "And my old-time cart is a rootin' tootin' wreck!",
    ",",
    "But I thought you all wanted our help.",
    "Oof. I guess we owe all three of you an apology.",
    "Yup, I sure am glad Miss Cheerilee agreed to run the race over again.",
    "Has anypony heard from Pinkie Pie since yesterday?",
    "Uh, we're happy to help you, Pinkie Pie, but this seems like an awful lot of candy.",
    "I think we've had plenty. And shouldn't you be on your way to pick up Maud from the train station?",
    "Aw, what a great tradition.",
    "Never met a pony or critter who didn't love Granny Smith's apple spiced muffins!",
    "We're just gonna have the best time![beat]",
    "Uh, so this here's Winona. That's Owlowiscious, Tank, Opal, and Angel. Pinkie Pie told us you have a pet, too.",
    "Maud? Would you like to try one of Granny Smith's famous apple spiced muffins?",
    "Oh, uh, heh, that's not\u2013 Um...",
    "It's like looking for a pebble in a haystack.",
    "Well, you don't have to make it even harder.",
    "Uh, alright, fine...",
    "She sure is... different from what I expected.",
    "Maybe she was just acting a little 'off' because she was shy or somethin'.",
    "You 'bout done peelin' them apples for the cider, Maud?",
    "Oh, uh, yep. That's a very interestin' method you got there. [laughs nervously]",
    "No! I mean, nah. I'm sure there's plenty apples in it already.",
    "Sure, why not?",
    "What do you think, Maud?",
    "[nervously] We're practically twins, heh.",
    "[sighs] The truth is, we've all been tryin' real hard to get closer to Maud, but, well... maybe some ponies just don't click the way others do.",
    "We just wouldn't feel right makin' somethin' that means we're best friends if, well, we aren't.",
    "I've got a bad feeling about this...",
    "Watch out!",
    "We've seen how much you care about Pinkie Pie firsthoof.",
    "We're hidin' from her![All gasp]{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}",
    "Apple Bloom! I told you never to say that name.",
    "No good reason? You call protectin' yer kin no good reason? Why, as soon as my sister saw Zecora ridin' into town, she started shakin' in her lil' horseshoes.",
    "So I swept her up and brought her here.",
    "For safe keepin'.",
    "Not from that creepy Zecora.",
    "Born where? I've never seen a pony like that in these parts, 'cept... ''her''!",
    "That's just it, she lives in... the Everfree Forest![Crash that sounds like a thunderclap]",
    "The Everfree Forest just ain't natural. The plants grow...",

    "Apple Bloom! Hush and let the big ponies talk.",
    "Hey! Where's Apple Bloom?",
    "[sigh] That silly lil' filly! I told her to stay put!",
    "Apple Bloom?",
    "You get back here right now!",
    "Y-you keep your creepy mumbo-jumbo to yourself, ya hear?[Applejack, Rainbow Dash, Pinkie Pie, and Rarity speak over each other against Zecora]",
    "And you! Why couldn't you just listen to yer big sister?",
    "Who knows what kind of nasty curse Zecora could have just put on you?",
    "Just you wait, Twilight. You're gonna learn that some pony tales really ''are'' true.[dream sequence]",
    "''Just you wait, Twilight; some pony tales really are true.''",
    "[high pitched voice] I hate to say I told ya so, Twilight, but I told ya so![Spike and Twilight gasp]",
    "It's a curse, I tells ya!",
    "Good gravy, girl! What's wrong with you?!",
    "I agree with Dash! We'll go to Zecora's and force her to remove this hex!",
    "Now where does she think she's goin' this time?",
    "Stop right there! Turn around right now, missy!",
    "No?! You can't ignore a direct order from your big sister!",
    "Apple Bloom, you come back here right this instant! ''I'm gonna tell Big McIntosh on you!'' Aw, pony feathers.",
    "Rainbow! Thank Celestia! There's no time to lose! I need to get to Zecora's pronto! Giddy-up pony!",
    "YEEE-HAW!",
    "No, Rainbow Dash. Other way!",
    "I'm comin' for ya, Apple Bloom!",
    "Whoa there. Easy, Rainbow Crash.",
    "[grunt]",
    "[gasp] Apple Bloom! You're okay!",
    "What in the hay does that mean?",
    "Will somepony please talk normal?",
    "''Little'' jokes?! Very funny.",
    "[normal voice] I'm right here, ''little'' sis. I ain't tiny no more!",
    "Of course she is. Ponyville Days celebrates the founding of Ponyville, and she was right there.",
    "Whoo-ee! All right, Rarity!",
    "Probably ''more'' than a touch![lights buzzing on][cranking]",
    "I'll say.",
    "And I can get Sweet Apple Acres all ready for the cider tastin'.",
    "Uh, who's Trenderhoof?",
    "[panting]",
    "Uh, gee, thanks. Granny Smith always said, \"Pick an apple a day and keep trouble away.\"",
    "Uh, on the farm or in all of Equestria? 'Cause\u2014",
    "Is that a fact?",
    "Well, I hope you can relate to Ponyville.",
    "Look, I'm glad you're interested in Ponyville 'n' all, but I'm kinda busy with my chores. And if I can't get 'em done, there won't be a Ponyville Days festival for you to write about.",
    "Rarity, what are you wearin'?",
    "Aren't you too busy plannin' the festival to keep makin' new outfits for it?",
    "Really?",
    "[under her breath] Maybe you two should try it sometime.",
    "Well, it would help if the harness was on right. What are you doin'?",
    "Well if you're still interested ''after'' the festival I can teach you all about it. But right now, I need to get the plowin' done, if you don't mind.",
    "[grunts]",
    "Now, Rarity, you be careful. If you don't get the buckin' just right, you could sprain a hoof.",
    "Well, your way is definitely long on style.",
    "Now, if you'll all excuse me, I have some more chores to do. Inside![chickens clucking]",
    "Whew! Well, that was close.",
    "What are you talkin' about?",
    "Listen, I know you really want Trend to like you\u2014",
    "I swear I don't know why he's payin' so much attention to me. And I don't know anypony who's that interested in farmin'. Not even me!",
    "Shouldn't you be workin' on the festival instead of comin' up with new ways to impress Trend?",
    "I'm too scared to guess.[lights buzz]",
    "[laughing]",
    "Rarity, that is the silliest getup I have ever seen!",
    "Because you would never dress like that. You like fashion and high society and fancy things.",
    "But you don't!",
    "Because I know you.",
    "And I suppose it's just a coincidence that Trenderhoof seemed so interested in country life, too?",
    "Well then, I guess I'll just have to show you!",
    "[growls]",
    "[upper-class accent throughout] Why, Rarity, whatever would make you think I was joking?",
    "And I can like fashion just as much.",
    "Well, maybe you do not know me as well as you think.",
    "Life is a festival, and you should celebrate it by looking just like me! Because I'm a trend-setting fashionista![camera snapping]",
    "Oh, is that so?",
    "[gasp] Not me! My mane needs to be perfectly coiffed at all times.",
    "My hooves are so polished, you can see your reflection in them.",
    "I'm ''so'' fashion-forward.",
    "I smell like rosebuds.",
    "[normal voice] There's the Rarity I know!",
    "I kinda know how you feel.",
    "Thanks! It's nice, ain't it?",
    "Oh, it's, uh, one of yours.",
    "and",
    "Well, that's real nice, but I sure hope you weren't thinkin' of Sweet Apple Acres.",
    "Uh, look, you're a fine pony, but, uh, well, I'm, uh...",
    "What do you think, Rarity? Is it too late to go back to \"Small Town Chic\"?",
    "You bet they are, birthday boy.",
    "C'mon, Spike, you already thanked me fifteen times. I'm startin' to get a little embarrassed.",
    "Now who in Ponyville would steal my apples? For that matter, who would steal my leaves?",
    "[laughs] Oh, that's a good one, Twilight. Sweet little Spike, running wild. Ha, what a laugh.",
    "Twilight, get my rope.",
    "and",
    "Get us out of here right now!",
    "[gasps] What was that?",
    "What in the name of Celestia's goin' on up there?",
    "Buck up, Sugarcube. You just ain't yourself these days.",
    "[awkwardly] Uh... it's okay. Tank'll come back in a few months.",
    "Alright, alright. There, there. [hushed, to Fluttershy] Nice going, Fluttershy. How do we get her to stop?",
    "Nope, I'm good.",
    "It's true.",
    "[hushed] You think she's done or just getting a third wind?",
    "The fun's come early! Yee-haw![splut]",
    "I'm glad you're feelin' a little better, Rainbow Dash.",
    "See you later, little feller.",
    "Yeehaw![thump]",
    "Well, howdy-doo, Miss Twilight, a pleasure makin' your acquaintance. I'm Applejack. We here at Sweet Apple Acres sure do like makin' new friends!",
    "So, what can I do you for?",
    "We sure as sugar are! Would you care to sample some?",
    "''Soup's on, everypony''![thump]",
    "Now, why don't I introduce y'all to the Apple family?",
    "This here's Apple Fritter. Apple Bumpkin. Red Gala. Red Delicious, Golden Delicious, Caramel Apple, Apple Strudel, Apple Tart, Baked Apples, Apple Brioche, Apple Cinnamon Crisp... [deep breath] Big McIntosh, Apple Bloom and Granny Smith. Up'n'attem, Granny Smith, we got guests.",
    "Why, I'd say you're already part of the family!",
    "Are you all right, sugarcube?[train whistle blowing]",
    "[muffled] Whoa there, Nelly...",
    "What?!",
    "What?!",
    "I know. But I had to say it again because that's how confused I am. You want ''me'' to judge a fashion show?",
    "Uh, I think I might be a little ''too'' practical. My closet's nothin' but twenty versions of this hat.",
    "Well, if I'm bein' honest, I don't think I'm the right pony for the job. Fashion just ain't my bag of oats.",
    "Sure, I... guess I can do that for ya.[shimmering magic sounds]",
    "Yeah, I know, Big Mac. I-I was just as surprised as you are. [grunts][apples thudding]",
    "I mean, heh, can you imagine? ''Me'', judgin' a fashion show?[pause]",
    "Well, you're the exception in our family, sugarcube. You know about that kind o' stuff. I'd be as useful as a burned knot on a zapplin' tree. [grunts][apples thudding]",
    "Although... Rarity ''did'' say I just had to focus on practicality. She already has experts for the... uh, fashion-y stuff. Eh, but I still wouldn't know what to say.[thunk][thud][apples thudding]",
    "Come on, Apple Bloom! You're doublin' our workload here!",
    "That's because it's ''not'' like mine. [grunts] You don't need a fancy scarf to keep your hat on. Now you can see. [grunts][apples thudding]",
    "Sure thing. You know what? I ''am'' gonna help Rarity judge her show! I think my sensible \"everypony\" take on fashion is exactly what the pony community needs![bell rings]",
    "Rarity, I thought about it some more, and if you still need me, I'd love to be a judge.",
    "It sure is great to hear Miss Pommel is doin' so well.",
    "Oh. Wow. Uh, that is just... wow. These are clothes?[music winds down]",
    "This is... [scoffs] She looks like a disco ball! Hah! D-Did they have to roll her down the runway?! [laughing] I can't believe anypony would actually ''wear'' this! [laughing] Am I right?",
    "Oh, gosh. I didn't mean to make her faint.",
    "I have no idea what you're talkin' about.",
    "Uh... Huh?",
    "Well... it's a lot of black. It's kinda... depressing.",
    "Maybe to fashion experts like you. But to ponies like me, it's still black.",
    "And I'm not sure how you wear singin' birds or the future. [to Rarity] I don't think they liked what I had to say.",
    "Are you puttin' holes in the clothes?! On purpose?!",
    "More like an old and tattered look! When a pony's old clothes get holes in 'em, they don't wanna go to the store to buy ''new'' clothes with holes in 'em!",
    "Sure, it ''looks'' pretty, but that's a lot of fabric. With the way it drags behind, it'll be covered in dirt in no time. Thank goodness I'm here. Otherwise, we'd have had holes in clothes and dirty dresses.",
    "[groans]",
    "So, uh... when are you gonna do her mane?",
    "Uh, can't wait to see what y'all do for the big show tomorrow!",
    "Heh! Great! At first, I didn't think I'd be much help. But thank goodness I signed on! Without me, they'd be doin' all kinds of crazy fashion-y things![off-key guitar chord]",
    "To me, they convey wakin' up an hour early just to button 'em all! And that's if you could reach most of 'em![buttons clattering]",
    "Heh. There you go! Now when it's cold, you just slide it on ya, and you're set. Like a poncho!",
    "Who cares if it's stitched perfectly? You don't need feathers on your head![feathers fluttering]",
    "My little sister tried to add some flair to her hat, and guess what it got her \u2013 an extra hour of work pickin' apples off the ground!",
    "[chuckling]",
    "What? Oh, no. Uh, it's just, I mean... Those belts look the same.",
    "You're kiddin', right?",
    "They're havin' a heated debate about those two belts.",
    "''No!'' There ''is'' no choice! They're the exact same belt! Ugh! This is so silly! ''Fashion is ridiculous!''",
    "I do! I'm sorry, but that's my honest opinion!",
    "What? I was just bein' honest!",
    "Why are you mad at ''me''?! I was just sayin' what I thought! And isn't that why you wanted me to be a judge?! For my honesty?!",
    "But it's ''my'' opinion! And I'm not gonna lie!",
    "What?! Why?! They're crunchy, they're sweet, they're delicious.",
    "You're right! Apples are ''better'' than strawberries!",
    "[stammering] You'd better apologize!",
    "''What?!?'' [growling]",
    "Well, that's fine if she doesn't like 'em! But if she knew how hard we worked to make our apples perfect, maybe she wouldn't be so mean about\u2014! ...Ohhhhhhh... Oh, boy.",
    "Nope. No, it does not at all. [sighs] I am so sorry, Rarity. I got so carried away with bein' honest, I guess I didn't think about how I was makin' others feel. [sighs] I'm a real rotten apple.",
    "Yup. But you're not goin' back to Canterlot yet.",
    "Hey!",
    "[panting]",
    "Whew... Listen, y'all. I thought I was just bein' honest when I said all those things. But somepony helped me realize I was actually bein' hurtful. So for that, I apologize.",
    "Uh... Well, I, uh... I still don't understand it. But I appreciate how much it means to y'all and how much hard work you put into it. I also know this contest is important to Rarity. So what do you say?",
    "Anything.",
    "Show's back on, fellers!",
    "[grunting] Ahhh...[sewing machine whirring][screech][muffled humming]",
    "[grunting][sewing machine whirring]",
    "Aah![fwump!]",
    "[laughing]",
    "I don't think that word means what you think it means. But I ''did'' bust my tail because I know how much this means to ''you''.",

    "Aw shucks, Apple Bloom. I sure hope so.",
    "Oh, shucks. I'm not much for speeches.",
    "Buuut! This here is the nicest send off anypony could ask for. Y'all have been cheering me on in every rodeo since I was a ''little'' little pony. So it seems only fittin' to use my winnings to fix up town hall. I promise to make Ponyville proud.",
    "You betcha, Granny Smith.",
    "You betcha, Mayor.",
    "I'll do better than my best!",
    "Guess that means me.",
    "Darn tootin'! See y'all in a week, with a big bag full of blue ribbons!",
    "Huh, some ponies. Sheesh.",
    "Uh, hey, everypony. What's up?",
    "Aw shucks, Miss Jubilee. You don't have to go into all that.",
    "S'no big deal, guys. I thought cherries would be a nice change from apples, so I took the job and came here. That's it. End of story.",
    "Sorry, but that's all there is to tell. Thanks for checkin' on me, but y'all can go home now. Tell my family hi, and that I'm doing a-okay.",
    "Well, I didn't ask you to come lookin' for me! There is nothin' to tell and I am ''not'' going back to Ponyville!",
    "Sure am, Miss Jubilee.",
    "What are you all doing here?",
    "Fine.",
    "What are you five up to?",

    "Canterlot was fine.",
    "Yes.",
    "Some.",
    "Yes, I saw 'em both.",
    "Um, well, Miss Jubilee had a cherry stand at the rodeo. Real good treats.",
    "Cherry winks, cherry cheesecake, cherry tarts. We struck up a conversation, being orchard folk and all.",

    "Pinkie, I did not break my promise!",
    "If y'all reckon back, I told you that I would tell you everything ''at breakfast''. But I didn't come for breakfast. I couldn't come to that breakfast, not if it meant telling y'all what happened.",
    "I'm sorry, Pinkie, but I can't tell y'all the truth. I just can't!",
    "Yes. Hyah![train whistle][crunches]",
    "Yee-haw!",
    "Ha, try and catch me now. Oh, nuts.",
    "Fine. Now you know.",
    "Well, just look!",
    "Don't you get it? There's every color of ribbon down there. Every color... but... blue. I came in fourth, third, even second, but I didn't win ''one'' first prize, and I certainly didn't win any prize money.",
    "That's why I came here. I wanted to ''earn'' some money. After that big old send off Ponyville gave me, I just didn't have the nerve to come home empty-hooved. I couldn't come home a failure.",

    "Uh, sure, why not?",

    "Okay, I get it, havin' somepony to do things for you would be a dream come true. But I don't feel right havin' Spike thinkin' he owes me somethin'. And you tasted that pie. Sometimes, his help isn't that helpful.[crash]",

    "Come on! We're burnin' daylight!",
    "Now, we gotta get up that peak! I figure if we use some rope and elbow grease, we can make it up half\u2014",
    "Oh. [chuckles] Sorry, Fluttershy. I suppose I got a little too caught up in the adventure.",
    "and",
    "Show yourself!",
    "Well, hi. I'm Applejack, and this here's Fluttershy.[beat]",
    "Huh. [to Fluttershy] Quiet bunch, ain't they? [clears throat] We're from Equestria, and we're plumb tickled to meet y'all.[beat]",

    "[stressing] Do. You. Un-der-stand. Ponish?[beat]",
    "Don't or won't?",
    "Like talkin' to Angel Bunny?",
    "Well, how are we gonna solve a friendship problem if none of 'em will tell us what it is?",
    "These Kirin are quieter than an apple blossom on snowfall. Still, there's gotta be some way to make 'em speak. [chuckles] Beautiful day, ain't it?[beat]",
    "[whinny] Knock, knock! Now you say, \"Who's there?\"[beat]",
    "Police. \"Police who?\" Police [please] say somethin'![beat]",
    "Uh-oh! I feel a sneeze comin' on! Aaaa-CHOOOOO![beat]",
    "[groans] Don't any o' y'all talk?![beat]",
    "Now we're gettin' somewhere.",
    "Tell you what, sugarcube. You stay and see if you can get anythin' outta these here Kirin. I'll go and try to find one that talks.",
    "[yelps] Phew! [yelps] Oh. Have you seen a Kirin that talks?[beat]",
    "Any idea where I should look?[beat]",
    "Oh, for the love of Celestia! Can't ya just say ''somethin'<nowiki />''?!",
    "That... was somethin', all right.[wind whistling]",
    "Oh, wow. [gasps] This... is amazin'.",
    "I was gonna say it's pretty. But yeah.",
    "Whoa there. Vow of silence?",
    "I hope it's not a sore subject, but... you mind explainin' why y'all went quiet in the first place?",
    "[sighs] You'd rather not talk about it?",
    "I-I under\u2014",
    "[gasps] I can't believe it! Nopony should give up feelin'... their feelin's just to keep from gettin' angry!",
    "[gasps] I bet this here's the problem that Fluttershy and I came to help y'all with!",
    "Right... Well, I'm thinkin' if we just go talk to the other Kirin, we can get 'em to welcome you back proper-like. Maybe even convince 'em to take your cure.",
    "There's no cure left?!",
    "[sighs] Well, this wouldn't be a friendship quest if it was easy. I'm gonna start by gettin' your friends to welcome you back!",
    "[panting] Fluttershy! Guess what!",
    "and",
    "Bet that's a problem the Kirin never have.",
    "Anyhow, we gotta get 'em all talkin' again.",
    "I thought you said you figured out the friendship problem. Was somethin' lost in translation?",
    "Heh. That seemed less scary when it was in a song.",
    "But that's no reason to stop talkin'.",
    "Not if they don't turn into fire-breathin' Nirik in the first place.",
    "There's gotta be a better way than givin' up all your feelin's!",
    "'Cause you're not talkin' any sense!",
    "and",
    "Aw, shucks! We were just havin' a normal, civil disagreement! Honest!",
    "To the Stream of Silence! If we hit that water, we'll never be able to talk or feel anythin' ever again!",
    "and",
    "It's all right. I think I know this one. And she's tryin' to help.",
    "You have no idea. Fluttershy, meet Autumn Blaze.",
    "And givin' up happiness to keep away anger is no kind o' life.",
    "I know you're worried about fightin'. But friends can disagree without causin' a ruckus.",
    "What?! When do ''we'' ever argue?",
    "and",
    "We don't always see eye-to-eye. But we never let that get in the way of our friendship.",
    "I-I think they're tryin' to say somethin'.",
    "Well, it would be. Except there aren't any flowers left to make the cure.",
    "They're called foal's-breath.",
    "Uh, Fluttershy? A little help?[squirrel chittering]",
    "Well, what are we waitin' for? Lead the way!",

    "She is the best flyer in Ponyville.",
    "Good luck!",
    "Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash hasn't even been gone twenty-four hours yet. Give her a chance to settle in first. Why don't we just go see what Twilight's up to? I hear Princess Celestia's got her workin' on some new spells!",

    "We wanted to bring you a care package. Didn't realize you'd be in the middle of some crazy tornado drill.",
    "You did ''what''?!",
    "What can I do for you?",
    "Of course I am. This is my home. But who in tarnation is Pinkie Bow and Flutterdash? Or you for that matter?",
    "Nope. Honestly, the only name I recognize is Rarity, but she left for Manehattan years ago.",
    "Not that I know of. Last I heard, she went to help with the cause like everypony else.",
    "The war against King Sombra and the Crystal Empire?",
    "Where have you two been?",
    "Did you bump your head on a crate of cider or somethin'?",
    "Well, I'll admit. I've lived in these parts my whole life and I've never seen this before.",
    "But I still don't see what this has to do with you and I bein' friends.",
    "Different how?",
    "That's easy enough. [sighs] When the Crystal Empire returned, it brought King Sombra back with it.[flames whooshing]",
    "[voiceover] And it didn't take long for him to force every one of his subjects to fight for him against Equestria.[marching][plane engine noises][sounds of battle]",
    "[voiceover] And even with Princess Celestia leadin' the charge, it still takes every last pony in Equestria doin' their part, workin' day and night, to keep up the fight.[train whistle]",
    "But we aren't friends. At least not here.",
    "Look. I hope all this helped, but I really need to get back to cannin' those apples.",
    "[sighs] I hope you do.",
    "Jumpin' junebugs, Twilight! When did ''you'' learn to fly that fast?[electricity crackles]",
    "All right, y'all. I think we've warned everypony to stay inside.",
    "Surely you saw this comin'.",
    "You think that might be the last one we need?",
    "YEE-HAW! Git along, little dogie.",
    "Whoa! All yours, partner.",
    "How are we gonna get rid of this thing?!",
    "Don't you play dumb with us, Discord! We know you're the one behind all of this!",
    "Works for me!",
    "[sigh] Gone.",
    "That tureen's only doin' what you're makin' it do!",
    "Scoot your boot, Apple Bloom. It's not like it's the Harvest Day Parade! We're just goin' to the train station!",
    "[sigh] Your cousin isn't gonna care what you're wearin'. Just pick somethin'!",
    "You know what would make a good impression?",
    "''Bein' on time to pick her up''!",
    "You got nothin' to worry about, sugarcube. Y'all are gonna get along great. You already have somethin' in common.",
    "Neither of you have your cutie mark.",

    "Ah, that's her!",
    "[laughs]",
    "Y'all are letting Babs ride in your golden apple float?",
    "Well, that's just super sweet of y'all, makin' Babs feel so special. Y'know, after all the heartache she's been havin' in Manehattan.",
    "Well, I didn't say nothin' 'cause I didn't want her to feel singled out, but there's been some bullies back in Manehattan just been teasin' her to pieces for her blank flank.",
    "Yup. She came up to the farm to get away from all her problems back home. I'm so proud of y'all. You've done a good deed.[balloons deflating]",
    "Huh?",
    "What?[band stops]",
    "Are y'all okay?",
    "[sighs] Y'know, ''this all could've been avoided if y'all just came to me in the very beginning.''",
    "Good. And if you have any problems, we've got your back too, y'hear?",
    "Bad seed? I thought y'all were friends now?",
    "Yea... No.",
    "Hey, y'all! What's everypony\u2014? Ohhh. Traditional holiday meltdown?",
    "[calmly and quietly] Hey, Twilight. How's your day?",
    "Stop! Take a breath.",
    "Now let it out sloooooooooowwww...",
    "Now, I think I have an idea that might help. What if we change up how we give gifts this year and do a Hearthswarmin'<!--\"Hearth's Warming\" or \"Hearthswarming\"?--> Helper?",
    "Whenever the ''whole'' Apple family got together, there were just so many of us, it didn't make sense to buy everypony gifts. So we'd put our names in a hat...",
    "...then we'd pull a name, but keep it a secret.",
    "Instead of buyin' everypony a present, you just get one for the pony you picked from the hat.",
    "We just need to put everypony's name in this here hat.[ripping and writing]",
    "Y'all ready? No peekin'.[music]",
    "That's perfect! Pinkie and I can spend the evenin' with y'all and the next mornin' with our families!",
    "If you can figure out who has the pony you want and they're okay with tradin', I guess it's fine.",
    "I don't have Rarity.",
    "Uh-huh.[doors open]",
    "There you are! I need your help.",
    "What? No. I just need help figurin' out what to get Spike.",
    "Hopefully, any''dragon'', too. Wanna split up? Meet back here in an hour?",
    "I've narrowed down my choices for Spike to fire-dancing sticks, or a ''Power Ponies'' comic. Unenchanted, I think. Aah! What is ''that?!''",
    "Egh. Why'd you think ''that'' was a good gift for Rainbow Dash?",
    "\"Short supply\", huh? How much did that set you back?",
    "Somethin' about this here doll seems fishy. And I ain't just talkin' about the smell of that plastic. Where'd you get it?[ponies chattering][music]",
    "Flim and Flam! What are those two Hearth's Warmin' hooligans up to now?![wind whistling][creaking][knock, knock!][door opens]",
    "[clears throat]",
    "What are y'all doin' with these dolls and that ridiculous getup? Don't you have a resort to run?",
    "It ain't no excuse for sellin' cheap dolls to ponies.",
    "[groans]",
    "Convincin' ponies to buy that doll ain't in the holiday spirit!",
    "Huh. But maybe we can ''show'' 'em![snow crunching][thud]",
    "Same as everypony else.[bits jingle]",
    "I want a Hearth's Warmer. In fact, I want three!",
    "[overacted] After I saw my friend here with hers, I knew I had to buy some for my granny, my brother, and my little sister!",
    "[overacted] But, Fluttershy, this is the must-have gift of the season.",
    "[overacted] That's true! I guess I need to put more thought into getting the right gift for each pony. Can I return these?",
    "Oh, uh, you want 'em? I'm gonna go pick out gifts that are just as special as the ponies they're for.",
    "[sighs] The sweet sounds of the season.",
    "Puttin' those two in their places makes me all warm and fuzzy inside.",
    "It probably ain't what they're expectin', but we still got these. Yay.",
    "Yeeeeeah...[knock, knock]",
    "How are we gonna get rid of this thing?!",
    "Pops said sometimes the hat chooses the pony when he gave me this. Hopefully my gift inspired whoever's wearin' it to be the best farmer ever.",
    "We got a bit distracted with Flim and Flam's shenanigans.",
    "I guess Hearthswarming Helper was kind of a disaster.",
    "Gosh, Rarity. I know hard work when I see it, and it looks like you worked your hooves to the nub!",
    "That Sassy totally stepped on your hooves, Rarity.",
    "[under her breath] Is she sure she doesn't wanna do it ''herself''?",
    "Uh...",
    "Uh, beg pardon, but could we maybe move things along? This here cake's a mite heavy. Right, Big McIntosh?",
    "Phooey on the festivities! I can't wait to try all those tasty treats![slap]",
    "Yeah, I'm gonna hit the hay myself.",
    "Yeah, those chefs aren't going to do your cake any harm.",
    "What is it?",
    "Uh, ''you're'' investigatin'?",
    "[hocks, spits][wind whistling][thunk][slow motion sounds]",
    "Whoa! Oof! Ugh! Well, I ''was'' practicin' my distance buckin'.",
    "Because Cousin Braeburn and the rest of the Apple family in Appleloosa seem to think that ''their'' team can beat Ponyville at buckball.[thunk, smack][thud]",
    "[grunts]",
    "[grunts][crash]",
    "So I can count on ya to join the Ponyville buckball team?",
    "Hmm?",
    "[groans]{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}",
    "Hmph. An expert who hadn't heard of the game either until I told you.",
    "The point is, my cousin Braeburn somehow convinced a Pegasus ''and'' a unicorn to come play with him on the Appleloosa team, and he can't stop braggin' about how his team is gonna beat ours!",
    "We'll play against each other along with whatever unicorns want to try out until we find the best one.",
    "I know a lot of you are here because I told you what an amazin' game buckball is. And even though it's already an Apple family favorite, most o' you probably don't know anything about it. So I thought we'd give you a quick demonstration. The two Earth ponies are on offense. They meet in the middle of the field for the buckoff. They both try to be the first one to kick it.[ball bounces]",
    "[grunts]",
    "And all the unicorns have to do is float these here baskets around the outside of the field and catch as many balls as possible for their team. [to Pinkie and Fluttershy] You two get the idea?",
    "Okay, just try your best, Pinkie. I ''have'' been doin' this a lot longer than you.",
    "[dazzled] Nice kick.",
    "Great save, Fluttershy!",
    "Where did Pinkie Pie learn to buck like ''that''?",
    "Um... okay. Well, let's see what the rest of you can do.",
    "Now, don't expect to be able to beat me twice in a row.",
    "[grunts]",
    "Nope. Um... okay. Let's see what the rest of you can do.[bonk!]",
    "Definitely not.[whirl!]",
    "Not a chance.",
    "Nope.",
    "It sure didn't.",
    "Amazing!",
    "Catch!",
    "Huh. And after today, it's pretty clear who the other two players should be.",
    "I can't explain it, but you two are really good at this game. And if it means beatin' Appleloosa, I'll give either one of you my spot on the team quicker than Granny Smith can core an apple.",
    "Well, you can have all the fun you want as long as it's while you're beatin' the hide off of Braeburn's team.",
    "All right. But if we ''really'' wanna beat Appleloosa, we're gonna have to get serious.",
    "With serious practice!",
    "That's why, before we leave for Appleloosa tomorrow, you two are gonna practice just as hard as we would.",
    "All right. Bein' able to buck a ball into a goal from any direction is the most important thing in the game.",
    "Keep it up! Just one miss'll ruin the Apple family's buckball reputation forever!",
    "Come on, now! Every shot is for Sweet Apple Acres! And me! And Dash! And all of Ponyville!",
    "Come on now!",
    "Keep it up!",
    "What in the apple happened to those two?",
    "All right! That's it for today, y'all!",
    "Just be sure to get your heads in the game before tomorrow. All of Ponyville is countin' on a win.",
    "Yup! We wanted to make sure you two knew that all of Ponyville was behind you!",
    "I hear the whole town's already plannin' a parade for when you get back after whuppin' Appleloosa! That should feel pretty good!",
    "Maybe us telling them how much everypony was countin' on them messed them up somehow.",
    "Get serious and play hard and\u2014",
    "[sighs] Guess not. We got so wrapped up in what's important to us, we went and ruined what was fun about the game for them.",
    "We know you're in here! We've looked in every other car on the train!",
    "[clears throat]",
    "Nope. We're gonna take your place. So you don't have to worry about that at all.",
    "Against us.",
    "Now I know we mixed up the teams before, but since Dash and I really need the practice, we'll play against the two of you.",
    "Yup. You two just do your best.",
    "Ahem.",
    "You must've noticed how you aren't bad anymore.",
    "And that just sucked the fun right out of the game for you.",
    "I'm sure folks want you to win, but not if worrying about it makes you miserable. Winning's never worth that.",
    "Ha. And as long as you're havin' fun, it doesn't matter if you win or not.",
    "Huh. Looks like you three made quite an impression!",
    ",",
    "[grunts] This door's shut tighter than a... summer of...[pulsing noise]",
    "...uh, piglets in... shoot! I can't even make countryisms no more!",
    "Well, it looks like you'll have plenty of time to try to think about it.",
    "But they're never gonna believe we switched over in just one night.",
    "Y'all don't understand, do ya? You can't force nopony to be friends! It don't work like that!",
    "[hushed] So what are we gonna do while Fluttershy's out there lookin' for our [whispering] ''cutie marks''?",
    "[grunting]",
    "Then let's get moving, y'all![pulsing noise]",
    "Yee-haw! Finally, I can buck like a five-bit snake herder in an Appleloosa ranch house again!",
    "I'll never get used to that.",
    "Looks like you were right, Twilight. The map ''did'' have a reason for sendin' us here. We brought real friendship to these here ponies. Guess that's why you're the ''Princess'' of Friendship.",
    "I know we've had this day marked on the calendar for quite a while, but it's finally here.",
    "The Confluence. A harvest a hundred moons in the makin'. When every apple comes ripe at the same time. Big Mac's been up late workin' on this schedule so we can be sure not to miss a single tree. All it'll take now is a few days o' hard work. Who's with me?",
    "That's great, Granny! Twilight and the others are too busy at the school to lend a hoof. We could sure use some more muscle. Who'd you get? Braeburn? Honeycrisp?",
    "Well, with a harvest this big, we're grateful for all the help we can get. I guess.",
    "and",
    "The Great Seedlin'? Well now. I haven't thought about that old mare's tale for years.",
    "Well, I'm pretty sure she's outgrown the whole thing by now. Right, Apple Bloom?[beat]",
    "Apple Bloom, you haven't hunted for the Great Seedlin' since you were little. Why would you want to start again now?",
    "Don't forget we have actual work to do, too!",
    "I don't mind Apple Bloom havin' fun. But there's honest-to-goodness work to do that doesn't have a thing to do with an old legend.",
    "Granny's right.[cat yowls]",
    "Come on, sleepyhead. Let's get to work.",
    "Hyah! Hwah![apples thudding]",
    "As much as I appreciate her volunteerin', I'm not sure how much help Goldie's gonna be.",
    "I love hearin' her and Granny spinnin' yarns, but it looks like the harvestin's up to us. You're gonna have to redo that schedule.",
    "And as much as I'd rather Apple Bloom were helpin', I guess there's no harm in her huntin' the Great Seedlin' for a day. Right? Big Mac!",
    "We fell behind a bit yesterday, so we need everypony at their best.[cat meows]",
    "He was just up late workin' out a new schedule so we can stay on track.",
    "I hope you're ready to cheer Apple Bloom up when her traps come up empty.",
    "What in blazes is all the excitement about?",
    "Yeah... Amazin'...",
    "Neither can I.",
    "Now, why would you go and do a thing like that?",
    "You know what I mean. We got enough work to do without you distractin' Apple Bloom by makin' some apple tracks and ''pretendin'<nowiki />'' the Great Seedlin' did it.",
    "Well, somepony did it. And ''she'' sure seems to be enjoyin' this quite a lot.",
    "Uh-huh. And I suppose you two didn't do it either?",
    "Ha-ha. Very funny.",
    "Apple Bloom?",
    "That's what I wanted to talk to you about. I know you're excited, but we sure could use your help today. Are you sure you want to spend time tryin' to catch somethin' that... might not even be real?",
    "I don't know who made the tracks. But I don't think it was the Great Seedlin'.",
    "Because the Great Seedlin' is just somethin' to make the harvest fun for young'uns. And you're old enough now to know that there's a time for fun and there's a time for work.",
    "[sighs] All right. How about this? If you help me with the harvest today, I'll help you set traps for the Great Seedlin' tonight. Deal?",
    "Kinda looks like those Seedlin' tracks, huh?",
    "Well, if enough apples fell or got knocked down by the wind maybe. Or animals.[beat]",
    "I'm just sayin' there's a lot of possible explanations.",
    "And the rest of 'em ''ain't''!",
    "[voiceover] And missed out on helpin' with the harvest because I was chasin' somethin' for little foals. I felt guilty everypony else had to work harder because of me. So I decided right then and there I was too old to waste any more time on Great Seedlin'.",
    "Then let's get to work.",
    "[laughs] I forgot what a good time it could be. If any two ponies can catch the Great Seedlin', it's us.",
    "Now, there's still plenty of harvestin' to do. So promise me you'll help, even if all our traps are empty.",
    "[laughs] Deal.[door opens][rooster crows][rumbling]",
    "and",
    "Now that's what I like to hea\u2014[whimsical music]",
    "Whoa.",
    "Huh?",
    "Every trap sprung? No way critters did this. Or the wind. I can't believe I'm sayin' this, but... maybe the Great Seedlin' really ''was'' here!",
    "I can't think of anything else that could've laid out these tracks ''and'' sprung all our traps.",
    "Well, tell us what you ''have'' seen! Goldie, you too! We need to know it all if we're really gonna catch him!",
    "Work? Apple Bloom and I don't have time to work today! We've got to set up traps in every row! Even the carrots! Just to be sure!",
    "That was before I thought we could actually catch him! Besides...",
    "...Big Mac can make time in the schedule for us to set traps, right?",
    "Great! Get to it! Apple Bloom and I are gonna go capture us the Great Seedlin'!",
    "Whew! All right! Just one more hill to go!",
    "Huh. Is this right?",
    "But that doesn't make any sense. How can all these trees be bare if we haven't bucked 'em yet?",
    "You're sayin' the Great Seedlin' is takin' our apples?",
    "Have you ever heard of anypony actually catchin' him?",
    "Well, his tricks have given me an idea. Settin' traps is one thing. But I reckon if we keep watch over the trees that haven't been bucked, the Seedlin' won't know what hit him!",
    "Guess it's just you and me.[paper tears]",
    "[chuckles] Me, too. It's been a long time since I was on a real Seedlin' hunt. And this is the first time doin' it with my little sister.",
    "I couldn't have been much more than a foal. I remember our parents tuckin' Big Mac and me in and tellin' us all about the Great Seedlin'. And I got so excited, I could barely sleep. So I\u2014",
    "Don't you worry, sugarcube. I won't let him get away.",
    "[snoring][clatter!]",
    "Huh? W-What is it?",
    "Well, let's go check it out!",
    "See anything?",
    "Don't scare him off. We got to lead him into one of the traps.",
    "Apple Bloom! Wait!",
    "[panting] Huh?",
    "Huh?",
    "and",
    "[panting][thudding][rattling]",
    "and",
    "He's been harvestin' in his sleep this whole time!",
    "Y-You okay, Big Mac?",
    "and",
    "...And thanks to all of Big Mac's late-night work, we brought in the whole harvest with time to spare.",
    "You know what, sugarcube? You're never too old to be a filly. There will always be work to do, but havin' fun together is somethin' you never grow out of.",
    "[chuckles] We're real glad you came, Goldie.",
    "Huh. Big Mac wasn't harvestin' the carrots. Just the apples.",

    "Looks to me like you don't have any left.",
    "I think I figured out the problem. You've got a small leak, and that means the steam takes just a little longer to build up. And while ponies wait, they get cold. Cold ponies start wrappin' themselves in towels, and all those dirty towels have to be cleaned because Ponyville Day Spa prides itself on cleanliness.",
    "Basically, losin' steam makes you use more towels. That means you do more laundry, which uses up the hot water you need to make more steam, so the problem just keeps gettin' worse.",
    "Rarity, are you kiddin'? I can't just leave things like this. I'm gonna need my tools.",

    "I'm sorry, Rarity, but I think I'm gonna have to finish these chores myself.",

    "I'm sorry, but I just couldn't let those spa ponies go another minute puttin' up with problems they didn't even know they had! Somehow they just got used to a huge bottleneck of ponies standin' around waitin'. An' I took one good look at that spa jam, and I knew I had to do somethin'! Sometimes the simplest things can just derail a whole operation. [babbles] Whether it's a leaky pipe or doin' too much laundry. You can't just stick to the same old way of doin' things and expect them to get better. [clucking] I mean, thinkin' you can is just plumb ridiculous. Right? [short laugh] It's funny when you realize the extra work they were doin' was actually makin' things worse![pigs squeal][pigs stampeding]",

    "What? Of course! Why would I be doin' it if it weren't? See, this gate here used to squeak so loud, the pigs would run to the other side of the pen and never come out! So I open and close it to let them know it's safe.",
    "Of course not! I fixed that ages ago. Then I realized puttin' a little fright into 'em got 'em all hustlin' out of the pen.",
    "Well, no. They got used to it. Which is why I started doin' the chicken dance! To show 'em that if they didn't get to eatin' their food, the chickens would. 'Course, bein' a chicken, I couldn't very well open the gate. Gettin' the food bucket to spill into the trough was just a happy accident because one time I left it there by mistake.",

    "[clears throat]",
    "Look, I know our cutie marks are amazing, but is that all we're gonna do now? Just spend our days starin' down at our own flanks?",
    "[wistfully] Yeah... [beat] This is ridiculous! We need to go out and do somethin'!",
    "Exactly.",
    "Or square dancin' on the mountain we just climbed! [same yodel over square dancing music]",
    "And the more things we try, the more chances we'll have to finally get our cutie marks! Come on!",
    "Wow... Did we really only ever do things ''just'' to get our cutie marks?",
    "Absolutely![montage music]",
    "We do exactly what we got our cutie marks in!",
    "Exactly! We just have to find ponies who need our help! Come on!",
    "Not even the ''slightest'' naggin' sensation that you don't really know what your purpose is in life or why you have a big apple as a cutie mark?[thump]",
    "The important thing to remember is that there is no rush.",
    "...we want you to know that we are here to help.",
    "This is gonna be a lot harder than I thought.",
    "The point is, helpin' ponies with cutie mark problems is what makes us special.",
    "A place where we'll go on to solve even more! Startin' with yours!",
    "We'll solve it because that's what we do!",
    "Yeah!",
    "Yeah!",
    "Maybe ''too'' easy.",
    "Well, it's lookin' like cutie mark problems are few and far between.",
    "And what if we never find another one?",
    "And even if we do, we could solve it so quick, it'll be like it never happened in the first place!",
    "So... then the Cutie Mark Crusaders don't have any reason to exist!",
    "Right! And\u2014",
    "Exactly. But even when we find problems, we're so good at solvin' them that most of the time there's nothin' for the Cutie Mark Crusaders to do. So...[map unfurling]",
    "I thought we should start figurin' out ways to search all of Equestria for cutie mark problems!",
    "But... what do we do ''until'' then?",
    "What do you mean?",
    "So... we can do things just for fun? Are you girls thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?!",
    "Makin' potions!|",
    "If you say so.",
    "[nervous laugh] I don't think I did it right.",

    "Didn't what?",
    "But we're the Cutie Mark Crusaders!",
    "I don't know... I guess I figured we'd always do stuff together. But bungee jumping sounds just as scary as crochet sounds borin'.",
    "I guess...",
    "But I don't know what it'll be.",
    "[sighs] Well... I guess now I have to.{{#lstOut On My Own|song}}",
    "Whatever kind of dancin' y'all are doin', you're doin' it together, and I want in! [beat] I-I mean, uh, [clears throat] Would it be okay if I enrolled in this dance class?",
    "That sounds an awful lot like friendship! And I'm ready for anything I don't have to do by myself!",

    "Whoa, whoaaa![sound of skittles being knocked over][thump]",
    "Whew! I feel like that went pretty good, but let's give it one more whirl, because it's important that I do a good job partnering with my new group of friends.",
    "I'm sorry, but doin' stuff on my own is exactly what I ''don't'' want.[door opens]",
    "Tryin' different things with my friends is always fun, even when we were terrible. Now it's ''just'' terrible.",
    "[sighs] Thanks, but... without my friends, I don't think I'll ever feel again. Good luck at the recital.",
    "[deadpan] Yeah, okay. Nice meetin' you.",
    "Oh, hello, girls. Have fun pursuing your ''own'' interests?",
    "[laughs] I did. I looked all over town. I looked... and I looked... and I looked... and you know what I found? ''Nothin'!''[blind snaps up]",
    "And each one just made me feel more alone than the next! I don't see how I'm supposed to be happy that we're not hanging out anymore!",
    "Oh. [beat] Well, I guess that changes things.",
    "Well, I kind of liked dancin', mainly because it looked like somethin' you couldn't do alone, but... I wasn't very good at it.",
    "I know... I met the best dancer in the world, but he was so shy, he couldn't bring himself to perform, even though he really, really wanted to.",
    "You're here!",
    "You told me that you wanted to perform more than anythin', but I was too caught up in myself to listen. You're the best dancer I've ever seen, and I'm here to convince you to get out on that stage![piano playing]",
    "We can go on together! No matter what, you'll look good dancin' next to me.[audience cheering]",

    "[taps] You know, I just might! It sure is a lot of fun, and I'm pretty confident I can only get better. [to the Crusaders] I'm sorry I was so silly about us all doin' our own things. If we hadn't, I might never even have tried dancin'!",
    "Well, one thing is for sure. The Cutie Mark Crusaders will never be the same. We'll be better!",
    "Everypony!",
    "Well, I got RSVPs from Apples from Yonder Hill, Hollow Shades, Galloping Gorge, Foal Mountain, Apples from Fillydelphia, Tall Tale Town, and all the Apples from Appleloosa!",
    "Oh! And how could I forget? Manehattan! Babs is comin'! I get to see my favorite cousin!",
    "Huh? Hey! Who put pillows on this rake?",
    "[growls]",
    "Uh, actually...",
    "I really wish my sister were here!",
    "I don't know. But come on, y'all. We gotta get Starlight out of there before she comes back.",
    "That's gotta be what's suckin' up all the magic in Equestria.",
    "I guess we're on our own.",
    "She's the one draining magic out of Equestria!",
    "Still, it's pretty impressive.",
    "It's just so excitin' to have a foal our age runnin' things. We should have an ice cream social every day!",

    "Hear ye, hear ye! This meeting of the Cutie Mark Crusaders is now in session! Who wants to do roll-call?[beat]",
    "Oh, ''nothin<nowiki>'</nowiki>''... except this letter from Babs Seed sayin' she's got her cutie mark!",
    "She says it's a pair of scissors!",
    "But if she spends all her time cuttin' hair, who's gonna run the Manehattan CMCs?",
    "Oh, wow. I guess you're right.",
    "No... or at least I hadn't...",
    "I guess I just spent so much time worryin' about how to get a cutie mark, I never even thought about what would happen after. There's just so many things I never considered.",
    "What if I finally get my cutie mark and I don't like it? What if I get my cutie mark and nopony likes ''me''?",
    "What if the Crusaders drift apart? I mean, we won't really be the Cutie Mark Crusaders anymore! [gasps] What if it's not an apple?! Will I have to move out?! ''Where will I live?!''",

    "[gasps] I can't believe it! I got my cutie mark! ''I got my cutie mark!'' [rumbling and echoing] ''I got my cutie mark!'' Wait 'til I tell the others that my cutie mark is a... a... What is it?",
    "Infestations? You mean like... parasprites?",
    "Twittermites?",
    "Pest ponies?",
    "Take over?",

    "That's not funny.",
    "Stop it!",
    "You know what? My cutie mark isn't the worst! You two are!",
    "[sighs] I hate to think that Diamond Tiara is right, but... this cutie mark sure isn't what I was hoping for.",
    "Who's there?! What do you mean?!",
    "Well, if you know how to wave a hoof and erase a terrible cutie mark, you go right ahead!",
    "Huh. Now ''that'' is some serious magic.[ponies panicked]",

    "Whoo-ee. That's what I call a nightmare. It seemed so real.",
    "Applejack! You are not gonna believe the dream I just had! I guess I needed more sleep than I thought!",
    "What?",
    "Again?! I mean... I did? Woo-hoo! Potion making! Now that's more like it!",
    "Never mind. I'm just glad Princess Twilight's lessons finally paid off!",
    "Whooo!",
    "[coyly] Oh, ''nothin<nowiki>'</nowiki>''... except this brand new cutie mark!",
    "I know!",
    "I don't suppose either of you got yours?",
    "I know it's silly, but I'd always hoped we'd get our cutie marks together.",
    "I know! [knocks on podium] Let's call this meeting to order! I'm sure the three of us can figure out how to get two more cutie marks.",
    "What?",
    "Oh, yeah... Just like Babs Seed... Well, I could just sit quietly in the corner 'til you two figure out what you're gonna do...",
    "Oh. Right. I guess I should just come back later, then...?",
    "Oh.",
    "What?![creepy forest noises]",
    "Sweetie Belle! Scootaloo! Come on, fillies, this isn't funny![wind blows]",
    "No! I mean, w\u2014 yeah, I mean... Well, I got mine, but my friends didn't get theirs, and now there's all kinds of trouble!",
    "I guess so... I mean, if I was a blank flank again, there wouldn't be a problem!",
    "Well, us blank flanks have to meet somewhere!",
    "You ''did''?! What are they?",
    "Wait! Hold on! I can get my cutie mark back, I think! Rrgh! I mean, I got it once, right? Oh, just wait a second! Nooooooooooo![rooster crows]",
    "What in Equestria's goin' on?!",
    "I'm not so sure sleep is the cure-all Applejack thinks it is.",
    "Uh... Applejack? I know you said sleep is supposed to make me feel better, but I'm pretty sure it's makin' me feel ''worse''.",
    "Wh\u2014 Didn't you hear what I said?! I was trying to\u2014",
    "What is it, Granny? What's wrong?!",
    "Oh, no! What is it now?![spotlights turning off then on]",
    "What?!",
    "But this is my home!",
    "Noooooooooo![thump]",

    "Alright, this is getting ''ridiculous''. [pause] Whoo-ee! I never thought I'd be so happy to ''not'' get a cutie mark. What the?![music playing backwards]",
    "[frustrated grunt] I don't wanna see another cutie mark as long as I live!",
    "All right, whoever you are! I dunno what spell you went and cast on me, but I want it to stop right now!",
    "Rrrgh! Why would I want you to torment me with nightmares?!",
    "I don't want your help! Just get away from me!",
    "Princess Luna?! My shadow? What do you mean? It's just me? You mean I've been doin' all this to myself?",
    "If I've been dreamin' this whole time, why don't I just wake up?",
    "Yeah... I guess I've been pretty worried about gettin' my cutie mark.",
    "But if I like who I am, do you think other ponies will too?",
    "Then it doesn't matter what my cutie mark is!",
    "But that's so simple! I must be the only pony in the universe this worried about her cutie mark.",
    "Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle are havin' nightmares too?",
    "Well, I guess I should call this ''dream'' meeting of the Cutie Mark Crusaders to order![podium honks]",
    "I know we all got pretty anxious when we found out Babs got her cutie mark, but I for one don't want to have nightmares every night from now until we get ours!",
    "And even though we're all a little scared, a cutie mark won't change who we are or how everypony feels about us!",
    "Exactly!",
    "I know! Let's put together a care package for her!",
    "We wouldn't want her to think that just because she isn't a Crusader, we can't still be friends! But, uh... maybe we should wait 'til we wake up.",

    "Um... thanks?",
    "What in tarnation does that have to do with anything?",
    "Why?",
    "And by tomorrow?",
    "Golly, I don't know, Scootaloo, I don't think that's the problem.",
    "Probably not.",
    "[yawns] But we've been rehearsin' all the livelong day! We're gettin' tired!",
    "[hushed] I liked the routine the way it was!",

    "Rrgh! You don't listen to yourself! Forget it. I'm goin' home to get some sleep.",
    "She'd better get here soon! This here train is about to leave!",
    "We were scared you were gonna miss the train!",
    "and",
    "You know what, Sweetie Belle? Forget it. If she's gonna quit, we don't want her, and we don't ''need'' her!",
    "Fine!",
    "Well, there ain't gonna be a Scootaloo.",
    "She got it in her head that the only way to represent Ponyville was by flyin' in our routine! When she couldn't do it, she told us that she was quittin'.",
    "...uh, that we didn't want a quitter.",
    "We're not goin'.",
    "Three kinds of ponies livin' together as friends. Just like us. Earth ponies...",
    "What?",

    "What does the rock look like?",
    "Oh.",
    "I had a dream once I was an apple.",

    "What a mess.",

    "Yeah! They like dangerous creatures, right? We got to have some of those around here. Like, uh, Timberwolves!",
    "Uh, then how would ''we'' hear about it?",

    "So the plan is we let 'em get a picture, then we hide again. Right?",

    "Then we're comin' with ya!",
    "Applejack neither. I bet she'd do the same thing for ''her'' friends.",
    "''We're'' the best.",
    "That's it!",
    "No. Scootaloo's parents are the only ponies in Equestria that can do what they do, right?",

    "No grass to run in and no hooves to run on it with. And excuse me, but how do you keep from getting all pruney? [sighs]",

    "I know! What do we do if he takes us back to Appleloosa and the sheriff arrests him? If I get a cutie mark for that, I'll feel guilty every time I see it.",
    "What are you saying?",
    "So he's been looking at his cutie mark wrong the whole time! It's not bad luck, it's\u2014",
    "But we've got a plan to help you live your dream!",
    "[simultaneously] You can do it!",
    "Trouble Shoes has a gift for making ponies laugh! He's maybe the best rodeo clown I've ever seen!",
    "It does feel kinda nice.",
    "Don't! According to my book, they're extremely poisonous![berries falling]",
    "[sighs][leaf landing]",
    "[gasps][snap]",
    "[grunts, screams]",
    "I heard something, I stepped on something, and I saw that ''creepy'' cave... I guess I still get a little bit scared out here, even after the last camping trip.",
    "This is gonna be the best Big-Sister-Slash-Little-Sister camping trip ever!",
    "Ow! What are these things?! Aaagh!",
    "Aaah! Not the scary cave![whoosh][Fly-der swarm buzzing]",
    "Where did those terrible bugs come from? And why did they destroy our camp?",
    "We aren't gonna tell scary stories like our last camping trip, are we? It's bad enough just being ''in'' here!",
    "and",
    "Yeah, I'd never believe it.",
    "[screaming]",
    "[panicking] What are we gonna do?! They're almost here![thwack][rubble falling][beat]",
    "[hyperventilating] And ''we'' can't get ''out''!",
    "[hyperventilating]",
    "How long will that be?! Don't bears live in caves?! [moaning]",
    "You have a plan?!",
    "Dragons?! Big, scary, mean ones or like Spike?",
    "[panicked sigh]",
    "[shivering] You said this wasn't too scary!",
    "What?[stretching, snap]",
    "Wow! I ''did'' like that ending.",
    "You mean go further into the dark, spooky cave?!",
    "[sighs] It's never looked so beautiful.",
    "And I bet ''we'' could find some more berries! Come on! I can't wait to see what happens ''next'' year![credits]{{Transcripts}}[[esTranscripciones/Historias de Fogata]]{{Infobox Transcript}}[banging]",
    "I mean... it's pretty amazing how the colors just pop off your flank. It's kinda hard to look aw\u2014[thump]",
    "Yeah, I suppose that could get real boring...",
    "Yeah, we need to go try new stuff like we used to!",
    "Or mountain climbing! [stock yodel]",
    "Aw, come on! We did lots of stuff that didn't have anything to do with getting a cutie mark.",
    "Ponies without cutie marks!",
    "Not even a ''tinge'' of dissatisfaction?",
    "The three of us tried for the ''longest'' time, but it just comes when it comes!",
    "So if you're having even the slightest problem...",
    "Kinda makes you wonder why ''we'' made such a big deal out of it for so long.[beat]",
    "What?",
    "...Maybe ''we're'' not special.",
    "[straining] The Crusader Clubhouse is a safe place, Mr... um... Bulk.",
    "No matter how long it takes!",
    "[nervously] Have you tried lifting other things?",
    "Yeah!",
    "What do you mean?",
    "Well...",
    "Ponies with cutie mark problems are hard to find.",
    "That kinda seems like a lot.",
    "Yeah, I'm sure we'll come across them in Ponyville. And when we do, we'll totally solve them because we are so awesome at it!",
    "and",
    "and",
    "Scootering!|",
    "Just remember \u2013 stomp, kick, and roll! After this, you two are gonna love scootering as much as me!",
    "Ready? Stomp, kick, and roll! Whooo![tires screeching]",
    "Ta-da![thump][thump]",
    "Harmony, huh?",
    "[''very'' off-key]''Mi!''|}",
    "Wow, that ''was'' simple![snap]",
    "Well, I know this might sound crazy, but what if we didn't?",
    "Do things together. Well, do ''everything'' together.",
    "And we always will be! But I ''really'' wanna bungee jump! The speed, the height, the fall!",
    "Isn't there something ''you've'' always wanted to do on your own?",
    "That's okay. Sweetie Belle and I can do the things we like, and you can do whatever you like!",
    "Great! Then we can meet back here and talk all about what we've done!",
    "Something awesome!",
    "Sweetie Belle! You are not gonna believe this, but I think I like bungee jumping even ''more'' than scootering!",
    "Wow, uh, that's, um...",
    "Awesome![door creaks open]",
    "Apple Bloom? What are you doing sitting in the dark?",
    "You tried every one of these?",
    "Wait, I never said that. I just said we don't have to do ''everything'' together.",
    "I can't believe you thought we didn't want to hang out anymore.",
    "And being good doesn't always mean you will.",
    "No problem!",
    "And trying new stuff might even make us better at helping them, like how I used my bungee jumping to change the sets!",
    "Sweetie Belle!",
    "We need to get help!",
    "Except for Cozy Glow. That pony is ''not'' who we thought she was.",
    "Hey, Cozy Glow! What's so funny?",
    "We can hang out with you all day if you want.",
    "It looks pretty clean already.[door slams]",
    "But she locked us in this closet!",
    "I'm pretty sure we're all here.",
    "and",
    "So... she's good at cutting stuff?",
    "Well, not Babs. She can't be a Cutie Mark Crusader if she's already got her cutie mark.",
    "There's the core, and sour apples, and rotten apples, and apples with worms in them\u2014 What?",
    "Why all the excitement?",
    "That's amazing!",
    "That's so cool!",
    "Nope.",
    "Me too...",
    "Absolutely!",
    "Well, you can't be a Cutie Mark Crusader if you've already got your cutie mark...",
    "I don't even think we're still supposed to be friends.[door slams]",
    "Hey, Apple Bloom. Why'd you want to meet here?",
    "Um, actually, Apple Bloom, we... both sort of got our cutie marks.",
    "Oh, we don't have time to go into all ''that''.",
    "Yeah, we've got responsibilities now.",
    "Much later.",
    "[screams][plop]",
    "[hyperventilating]",
    "and",
    "Cool!",
    "Me neither!",
    "Do you fillies think that Babs is worried or scared about some of this stuff?",
    "Maybe it's us!",
    "So what do you say we come up with the perfect routine and win this thing?",
    "Listen. Somepony in our class is gonna carry that flag, so it might as well be us! Crusaders, are you in or are you in? 'Cause I'm in!",
    "Alright, the winning routine needs to show what's important about Ponyville, right?",
    "So... what's special about Ponyville? It's... it's... I got it! It's a place where different kinds of ponies live together as friends!",
    "And Pegasi like me! So somehow we got to figure out a way to show that in our act.",
    "And a whole bunch of practice! But take it from me; we may just be little ponies, but we have hearts as strong as horses!{{#lstHearts Strong as Horses|song}}",
    "But we're winners! And we have [starts singing] ''hearts''\u2014",
    "Listen, you two! Cutie marks or no cutie marks, you'll see! The Crusaders are gonna carry that flag at the Games.",
    "Game on!",
    "Don't worry, we will!",
    "''Since the dawn of recorded time, in one town of amazing amazingness, three types of ponies coexist!''",
    "We are Pegasi! ''And the town where friendship reigns is our home. Now, welcome to the stadium, the flag of the place we love best...''",
    "It's kind of a work in progress. So? What did you think?",
    "You heard her! If we keep working hard, we might have a shot! So let's keep working! Trot to it, ponies!",
    "Brave? Why?",
    "So what if my wings can't get me off the ground?",
    "This routine isn't working how it is. We've gotta rethink my part in the whole thing.",
    "If we wanna win, I'm gonna have to fly!",
    "Maybe I can win if I work twice as hard. See? Oof! Maybe... three times as hard.",
    "Well, I know this for sure \u2013 flying is the only way we're gonna win, so it's back to practice!",
    "Whoaaaaa![thud]",
    "I'll just work ''four'' times as hard!",
    "[sighs] Guys, guys, guys! Try it again!",
    "Fine! We'll skip to my big impressive flying entrance. So you've done the do-si-do to the left, then to the right, and then there's the hoop. Then I come in\u2014[thud]",
    "Not quite what I had in mind. We'll just... try that part again. [straining noises]",
    "Don't worry, I'll be flying high tomorrow on our final run-through for Rainbow Dash. I'm gonna get this, you'll see. [straining noises][thud]",
    "[panting] Ponyville! Home of the, um...",
    "Ah, friendship, right! Uh, there are four\u2014 no, ''three'' kinds of ponies.",
    "Ta-da! Oof! [panting] So? What'cha think?",
    "What are we gonna do?! We're competing tomorrow, and I still can't fly! Unless...",
    "Of course I need you! Without you two, who's gonna hold up the hoop?",
    "So? Are you gonna leave me too?",
    "Come on, Scootaloo! Do it for Ponyville! Just got to try ''twenty'' times as hard! [straining noises] ''Thirty'' times as hard...! Oof! Just... a little... harder![thud]",
    "[straining noises] [sighs] I can't fly. I just... can't.",
    "Here I am...",
    "I... I'm not going.",
    "I'm the weak link. If I go, and fall, flop, or do anything but fly, I'm gonna blow it for you two.",
    "But you're better off without me!",
    "Fine!",
    "Rainbow Dash?",
    "I don't wanna see them. And what are they doing here, anyway? They're supposed to be on the train.",
    "I didn't want to ruin their chance to win just because I couldn't fly.",
    "But flying's what Pegasus ponies are ''supposed'' to do! You flew when you carried the flag in the games!",
    "...and Pegasi. But Rainbow Dash... what if... what if my wings never grow? What if I never fly?",
    "You know what this means, right?",
    "We are totally gonna get cutie marks in flag-carrying!",
    "But that wasn't the case with this. We were just helping Sugar Belle with ''her'' plan.",
    "[reading] \"I-love-you-Big-Mac-would-you-like-to-spend-the-rest-of-our-lives-together-I-hope-you-say-eeyup!\" And each word has to go into a dessert? That's... one, two, three, four, five, six, seven... Whoa!",
    "I think I've seen her add sugar to that bowl six times so far.",
    "Why would they suspect that we're holding an invitation pie and that Mrs. Cake is baking a twenty-one-dessert proposal?",
    "Shhhhhh!",
    "We can't give away the surprise! You need to play it cool!",
    "Better?",
    "Hold on... That looks just like the shelf Big Mac made for Sugar Belle. Weird.",
    "Big Mac![loud thud][crash!][door closes][raccoons snoring]",
    "Mrs. Cake isn't finished yet. We still have time.",
    "Granny!",
    "That's nice, Granny, but we really need to find Big Mac, so\u2014",
    "You sure about that?[roaring]",
    "What about you and your apple monster?!",
    "Except for the apple monster. That was Discord. And Mrs. Cake messing up those recipes. And Spike burning the messed-up recipes. And\u2014",
    "...it wouldn't have worked out the way it did!",
    "Aw, you're okay.",
    "This is no mess! These are the carefully arranged pieces of a unicycle I took apart and will be putting back together... as soon as Twilight shows me how. [squee]",
    "Ugh, I hate research!",
    "and",
    "She's using somepony ''else'' to build herself up, and without even putting any effort to learn her own skills like we do!",
    "''Check this out!''",
    "Cool!",
    "She helps us learn cool new stuff to do! That we ''actually'' do ourselves!",
    "And they won't be able to laugh at us when they're so busy trying to learn stuff of their own.",
    "I didn't hear them laugh at us once, Apple Bloom.",
    "So much for learning skills to be big shots.",
    "Huh?",
    "This feels like a trick.",
    "She's coming!",
    "All because of our love of learning!",
    "I couldn't help it! When I don't smile in a picture, I look sad.",
    "Twilight's gonna be so ticked at us.",
    "Whoa, so bright I can see myself!",
    "We gotta beat them to Twilight's so we can explain!",
    "We didn't mean for so many other ponies to be here! Honest!",
    "So you're not mad?",
    "And I was so afraid Twilight would be disappointed in us.",
    "We kinda rushed over and forgot to bring our stuff.",
    "You got us into this mess, kid. Might wanna roll with us.",
    "Ta-da!",
    "Guess we'll have to just keep on doing it without you now. Thanks, Twilight.[poof]",
    "Or because we look ridiculous?",
    "We're at my house![door opens]",
    "Yeah! What's it for?",
    "Aw, thanks, Aunt Holiday. But I'm not sure we can take credit for this one.",
    "[laughs] Come on, Auntie Lofty. You already have your cutie mark.",
    "What about a Wonderbolt quilt?",
    "Bye, Aunt Holiday! Bye, Auntie Lofty![door closes]",
    "I know. I just wish they lived closer. Nopony bakes like Auntie Lofty.[knocking on door][door opens]",
    "[gasps] They're coming home today!",
    "''My parents!''{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}",
    "I... just noticed your erasers needed dusting. [nervous laugh][soft thuds]",
    "''My parents are coming home to Ponyville today!''",
    "Nope. Their jobs are way too important for that. They travel to the farthest, most dangerous places in Equestria to study unknown plants and fierce creatures. And what they learn helps pony science and medicine. I'd go with them, but it's too dangerous. Once, my mom had to wing-wrestle a wyvern, and my dad got trapped in a chimera's cave for three moons! He still has the scars to prove it.",
    "[gasps] Mom! Dad! [squeals]",
    "Everypony, meet my parents \u2013 Snap Shutter and Mane Allgood!",
    "Aw, come on, Dad.",
    "Me, too, Mom. Did you get all my letters?",
    "And Princess Twilight said we're such good friendship tutors, she might even let us teach a class!",
    "I can give you a tour of the school if you want. I mean, if you're staying for a while this time.",
    "Really?!",
    "I can't believe it! That's awesome!",
    "This is the best day of my life.",
    "Wait, what?!",
    "But... my friends are in Ponyville.",
    "The only thing I see... is the end of the Cutie Mark Crusaders! [sniffling][gavel pounding]",
    "You can't let the blank flanks down just 'cause I'm gone. You got to keep being CMCs without me.",
    "[sobbing] Maybe you can find a replacement for me.",
    "[sobbing] Well, it's worse for me! I have to say goodbye to both of\u2014![door opens]",
    "[sniffles] Thanks for the tickets, Rainbow Dash. But I can't go.",
    "[sniffles] We ''are'' pretty good at coming up with ideas.",
    "That's where their new job is.",
    "Dad knows all about those. And cockatrices and bugbears. They only study super rare animals.",
    "This is what I wanted to show you. The tracks of the mysterious Everfree banshee beast!",
    "Legend says it has five claws and three wings. And it's suuuuper dangerous if you get close. If only somepony could prove it exists.",
    "[panicked whimpering] I think I heard something ''this'' way.[leaves rustling][camera clicks]",
    "[nervous laugh] Guess you solved the mystery.",
    "[whines]",
    "Yeah. Thanks, Dad. We're sending them to the Pony Book of Records.",
    "But... we... [sighs] How do you argue with that?",
    "[sighs][door opens]",
    "With prune juice?",
    "Better than perfect![drops splash]",
    "Thanks for trying, Apple Bloom. But I might as well face it. I'm gonna have to leave Ponyville.",
    "We're running out of time.[chains jangling]",
    "This has to work![door opens]",
    "Then you'll just have to go without me! I'm staying with the CMCs!",
    "It's more than hard! It's not fair! You're making me pick between my family and my friends!",
    "But I don't ''want'' to say goodbye! You're changing my whole life without even asking how I feel! [crying]",
    "To stay with my aunts. [tearing up] You heard my parents. There isn't another train to Shire Lanka for a month. If I'm not on it, they'll have to go without me.",
    "Are you sure? I don't want to get you in trouble.",
    "You're the best, you know that?",
    "[sighs]",
    "It's not your quilt we're sad about, Auntie Lofty. Mom and Dad are back. And they're making me move to Shire Lanka with them!",
    "Oh. I think the mailpony delivered your letter to my house. I love my family, but I love being with my friends, too. I don't want to have to choose.",
    "Their job is too important.",
    "Right...",
    "And nopony else can do that! So if my parents split us up, it'd be just as bad as them quitting ''their'' jobs!",
    "A little. I just want to show you something before we go.",
    "[gasps] Really?! [tearing up] Thanks, Dad! Thanks, Mom!",
    "That would be amazing! Will you... still come and visit?",
    "Are you kidding? CMCs forever!",
    "And on the way to figuring out what you're ''meant'' to do, you'll find a ton more stuff you like. That's what makes looking for your cutie mark so great.",
    "I don't know if we ''can'' help them tomorrow. Working with blank flanks one at a time takes for''ever''.",
    "Just like we used to! Oh, but it'd have to be somewhere big enough to handle all those blank flanks.",
    "''Camp Friendship!'' Oh. Sorry. I thought we were all gonna yell that one too.",
    "And blank flank affiliates! Come to our cutie mark day camp to find out what you're truly good at!",
    "Hey, Rumble!",
    "Come one, come all! Cutie Mark Day Camp is for blank flanks of all kinds!",
    "Horseshoe-tossing!",
    "That's what worked for us!",
    "U-Uh, Rainbow Dash is ''practically'' my sister, and she's a Wonderbolt too![beat][foals laughing]",
    "Good! 'Cause there's a ton of other stuff to try. We'll find you something you're good at.[foals cheering]",
    "Come on, Rumble. Isn't it fun just trying stuff?",
    "Of course! Let's all meet right back here tomorrow.",
    "[sighs] Everypony except Rumble. He didn't have much luck with anything.",
    "Well, we can't let Rumble quit camp just because he didn't find something he's good at then.",
    "Hey, Rumble!",
    "We just wanted to apologize for not finding anything you liked today.",
    "It's okay! We've all been there. But we won't give up on helping you.",
    "Not wanting a cutie mark is like not wanting to breathe!",
    "A blank flank who doesn't want a cutie mark? That's gotta be the strangest thing I've ever heard.",
    "Are you sure she didn't mean \"find their own ''way''\"?",
    "And we've got a whole camp full of ponies who ''are'' interested in getting cutie marks.",
    "You don't get a cutie mark just because you're good at something or even because you like it. There's more to it than that.[splat]",
    "Rumble, you came back!",
    "Whoa-whoa! You ''can't'' be a blank flank forever![foals gasping]",
    "Now hold on, everypony.",
    "Has everypony gone ''mad''?!",
    "It looks like whatever they want.",
    "Point is that Rumble is a madpony who must be stopped!",
    "Maybe ''we'' can't, but I bet I know somepony who can.[whoosh]",
    "Afraid of what?",
    "I don't understand. If Rumble wants to be a Wonderbolt someday, what's wrong with that?",
    "Attention, blank flanks of Cutie Mark Day Camp![thump][foals chattering]",
    "But on the ground, since not everypony has wings.[foals cheering][bouncing noises]",
    "Looks like Thunderlane was right about the obstacle course getting Rumble to come back over.",
    "You're not worried about getting your cutie mark?",
    "Order, order, everypony! I hereby call to order this meeting of the Rainbow Dash Fan Club![fans murmuring excitedly]",

    "I'd like to call to order the first ever meeting of the newest and most exciting club \u2013 of which I am the president, founding, and only member \u2013 the Washouts Fan Club!",
    "Hey! What are you doin' here?",
    "Oh, uh, y'know... mmm... s-s-stuff. Uh, definitely not starting a new fan club or anything.",
    "You eavesdrop on every meeting? That's weird.",
    "I just think maybe it's time for me to explore ''other'' fan clubs.",
    "Only the newest, and greatest, and only stunt troupe in Equestria!",
    "How can I explain it? Like the Wonderbolts, just twenty bajillion percent cooler! [squee]",
    "They do all sorts of extreme stunts that focus on daredevilry and sheer guts rather than boring old flight and formation junk.",
    "Are you just repeating everything I say?",
    "So you ''do'' get it! Aren't they awesome?!",
    "Awww. I ''knew'' we shoulda lined up last night.",
    "What do you mean? The show hasn't even started yet.",
    "Huh? Yeeeeeeeaaaahhh!",
    "Oh, yeah!",
    "Woo-hoo!",
    "I told you!",
    "I can't just go up and talk to them.",
    "[excited noises]",
    "Scootaloo. I'm Scootaloo. Hi.",
    "You two really know each other? Oh, my gosh! This is so cool!",
    "Oh. That's, uh, less cool.",
    "Really?",
    "[gasps]",
    "I'll do it! Can I do it?!",
    "[scoffs] I wasn't asking ''you''!",
    "Oh, what if I joined and dropped out super quick?!",
    "Where are we going?",
    "[yawns]",
    "[scoffs] Would've been a lot cooler if you had the Crushinator Jaws of Smashalot, patent pending.",
    "But with enough practice\u2014",
    "I don't\u2014",
    "[shakily] Uh-huh...",
    "More like \"follow your wingflaps\".",
    "[sarcastically] Thanks, super-talented flyer, for clearing up what ''I'' should do.",
    "I don't need you standing up for me!",
    "[laughing]",
    "Just because I look up to you doesn't mean I have to ''be'' you! But based on ''your'' definition of what makes somepony great, I have bad news. I'll ''never'' be the best of the best or a Wonderbolt! Because I! Can't! Fly! Is that what you wanted to hear? But not being able to fly doesn't mean I can't do something awesome! Like strapping my scooter to a multi-stage liquid-fueled rocket and jumping twenty-two wagons lined up in front of a roaring crowd!",
    "Absolutely. [to Rainbow] And there's nothing you can do to stop me!",
    "Good! Because I already have!",
    "Lightning Dust, I have to tell you. I actually started Equestria's first Washouts fan club! As far as I know. So this is a real honor, ma'am! Uh, do I call you \"ma'am\"?",
    "Wow. That sure is...",
    "Has anypony tested it before?",
    "[gulps][tape stretching]",
    "There's m-more?!",
    "No! I'm just thinking about drinking through straws.",
    "Of course! It's just\u2014",
    "I... Is that a thing?",
    "Okay. Now I ''am'' thinking about backing out.",
    "[whimpering][crowd gasps][whoosh!]",
    "I'm sorry for joining the Washouts. Lightning Dust wasn't who I thought she was. She didn't care about me being scared or putting me in danger. She only wanted a good show, even if it meant I got hurt. That's ''not'' the kind of pony I wanna look up to.",
    "The Rainbow Dash Fan Club![bang, bang, bang]",
    "You know, Rainbow Dash was right. Eavesdropping on your own fan club isn't weird at all.[credits]{{Transcripts}}{{Infobox Transcript}}[stretching sounds]",

And it's not just the main characters in our stories that make life so rich! It's ''everypony'' \u2013 those who play big parts and those who play small.

Getting to face all these challenges today was just what I needed. And facing them with you just made me realize even more how lucky I am to have somepony like you as a friend. We may not see each other very often, but I know you'll always be there when I need you. Just like she was there for you, Discord.",

    "You must be Sunburst. Starlight said you were a powerful wizard.",

I had decided to become a teacher, and the flowers symbolized my hope that I could help my future students bloom if I nurture them with knowledge.

    "Twilight! It is so lovely to see my star student.",
    "Well, I want you right by my side the entire evening, so we'll have plenty of time together.",
    "Welcome to the Grand Galloping Gala.",
    "Yes. Me too, Twi\u2014 oh, good evening! Welcome to the Gala. Which is why I\u2014 ladies! Lovely to see you again.",
    "[in background] Good evening! So nice to see you. Welcome!",
    "Run.",
    "That was the best Grand Galloping Gala ever!",
    "Oh, Twilight. The Grand Galloping Gala is always awful.",
    "That is why I was thrilled you were all attending. I was hoping you could liven things up a bit. And while the evening may not have gone as you planned, I'm sure you'll agree that in the end it didn't turn out so bad for this group of friends.",
    "Perfect, girls. No need to rush. Then of course, Cadance will enter.[Wagner's \"Bridal Chorus\" plays]",
    "I'll say a few words, and then we'll begin with the vows. Shining Armor, you'll get the ring from your best mare.",
    "You have a lot to think about.[doors slam]",
    "And that's why we're proud and honored to give them the Equestrian Pink Hearts of Courage![cheers and applause][pop]",
    "It's a wonderful feeling, isn't it? Watching your student shine the way you always knew they could.",
    "I can only imagine what that feels like.",
    "So you have an overachieving student. Sounds familiar.",
    "Heh. Go on.",
    "Only you can make that decision. It's a difficult one, but your heart knows what's right, even as it hurts.",
    "Uh, this is Twilight's fantasy, Spike. There is no wrong way to fantasize.",
    "This seems like a lovely path for Starlight. The changelings have so much to learn about how to enjoy love through friendships. Starlight would be busy for a very long time, but her work there would be very rewarding.",
    "Hmm. I was not aware that I was an expression. An appropriate one, of course, for even I don't know the answer. This is a momentous decision. You must consider all the possibilities.",
    "[laughs heartily]",
    "[continues laughing]",
    "Oh, Twilight, I'm not. I'm laughing because I had the exact same fears ''you're'' having.",
    "Let me tell you a story. Once upon a time, there was a very bright young filly.",
    "[voiceover] She was truly one of my best students.",
    "[voiceover] Yes, Spike. I was constantly surprised and impressed with her discoveries. But I noticed that her pursuit of academia was preventing her from reaching her full potential.",
    "[voiceover] Uh, yes, Spike. I had a decision to make. Oh, but it wasn't easy.",
    "Maybe I could close the library or throw a party in the castle. Oh, she'd have to talk to the other fillies then! Oh. I must send her away.",
    "[voiceover] I knew there was a special group of fillies in Ponyville, but I kept inventing all kinds of reasons why I shouldn't send you.",
    "What if she runs into a manticore? Or what if she gets pulled into Tartarus? Or, worst of all, what if she doesn't get along with anypony?!",
    "[voiceover] I kept you in Canterlot longer than I should have.",
    "Eventually, I realized all the anxiety I felt was because ''I'' didn't want you to go.",
    "I loved having you as a student. You challenged me and taught ''me'' just as much as I taught ''you''. I am embarrassed to admit it, but I was afraid if you made friends, you wouldn't need me anymore.",
    "I think Starlight Glimmer might feel the same way about ''you''. If that is what you're afraid of.",
    "Here we are after all these years, Twilight. We are living proof that letting someone spread their wings doesn't mean you no longer have a place in their lives.",
    "And if you're still worried, you can always make her write you letters.",
    "The birth of an Alicorn is something Equestria has never seen!",
    "It appears her magic is more powerful than that of a newborn unicorn!",
    "In light of the little one's abilities, this Crystalling might be more important than ever. [to Cadance] Perhaps you should address your subjects and remind them of that.",
    "Magic is disappearing all across Equestria!",
    "As for Cozy Glow, I can assure you \u2014 where she's going, she won't be causing any more trouble.",
    "Good morning, Twilight. Love the new hairstyle. Well, happy Tuesday!",
    "I'm fully aware that the last time Discord was here, he created serious havoc.",
    "Yes, I understand. But I have use for Discord's magic if it can be reformed to serve good instead of evil. This is why I've brought Discord here, because I believe that you are the ponies who can help him do just that.",
    "Need I remind you that ''you'' are the ponies who turned him back into stone like this in the first place?",
    "No need, Spike. I have them right here, and I've cast a spell so Discord can't take them and hide them again. Now where is Fluttershy? I believe she may know best how to begin reforming Discord.",
    "I realize that this is a tall order, but I wouldn't ask if I weren't confident you could get him to use magic obediently of his own free will.",
    "I do. Now, I must return to Canterlot for Equestria's royal summit. You may release Discord when ready.",
    "Congratulations on your success, ponies. I definitely sense a big change in Discord. [to Twilight] I'll leave the Elements of Harmony with you, Twilight. Just in case.",
    "You are both so thoughtful. Clearly Twilight is important to you. But don't you think ''you'' might be important to ''her'' as well?",
    "Your relationship with Twilight is certainly special, Spike. But I know from experience the relationship between a teacher and pupil is as well.",
    "After hearing your memories, I couldn't help but think of some of my own.",
    "Twilight Sparkle.",
    "You have a very special gift. I don't think I've ever come across a unicorn with your raw abilities.",
    "But you need to learn to tame these abilities through focused study.",
    "Twilight Sparkle, I'd like to make you my own personal prot\u00e9g\u00e9 here at the school.",
    "Well?",
    "One other thing, Twilight.",
    "Why so glum, my faithful student? Are you not happy that your quest is complete and you can return to your studies in Canterlot?",
    "Spike, take a note, please. ''I, Princess Celestia, hereby decree that the unicorn Twilight Sparkle shall take on a new mission for Equestria. She must continue to study the magic of friendship. She must report to me her findings from her new home in Ponyville.''[ponies cheer]",
    "''Halt, interloper!''",
    "No need to thank us. To be honest, we've recently realized we like being part of the action.",
    "And making a difference outside the throne room.",
    "and",
    "Did somepony say \"lost\"?",
    "Students going hungry? Not on our watch!",
    "Ah! A strategy meeting! What is the danger this time? A rampaging beast? Evil spell? Friendship problem?",
    "Not exactly. Battling the Everfree Forest alongside Star Swirl made us realize what we've missed out on. So, instead of spending the day ruling...",
    "...we wanted a chance to do the things ''you'' do. Save the day! Adventure with friends! Shampoo anteaters.",
    "What an intriguing idea. Only... it's much harder to justify a vacation from the castle when it's not an emergency we're responding to.",
    "Thank you, Twilight! What a relief to know the Royal Swanifying Ceremony is in good hooves. [laughs]",
    "\"Fun Not Yet Had\". [squeals] I can't wait to start planning our time off!",
    "Adventure!|",
    "[sighs] I understand. But for me, every day ''is'' real-world. Meetings and decrees and meetings about decrees and decrees about the meetings... I crave excitement!",
    "[gasps] We take turns doing what we like!",
    "and",
    "Oh. [nervous laugh] We'll be... twin-sies.",
    "I have a few things for us, too.[thud]",
    "Sunglasses, bug spray, ice boots, hoof sanitizer, and travel snacks!",
    "You have to add water. What do you think?",
    "And here are instructions of how to prepare for the Royal Swanifying.",
    "We have put a small part of our power in this amulet. You can activate it with your magic at any time. Preferably dawn and dusk.",
    "Remember, sister. From now on, we are regular, carefree ponies![excited chattering][camera clicks]",
    "Of course. [laughs] How new and different. It's just like Pinkie Pie said.{{#lstLotta Little Things|song}}[doors open]",
    "Exactly what I was thinking.",
    "''<span style=\"text-transformuppercase;\">ziiiiip liiiiiiiiiine!</span>''",
    "Now, every time we have tea, we can remember this magical day!",
    "Is it another zip line?",
    "It is indeed.",
    "You didn't need a stamp if you were just going to give this to me.",
    "[echoing] Did you know that nopony has ever explored the bottom of these caverns?[roaring][rocks crunching]",
    "[chewing, gulps] Well, I hope ''you're'' enjoying yourself on your super-relaxing picnic, sister.",
    "Well, they hurt less than that horrible howling you dragged us to.",
    "Oh, just face it, Luna. You are never happy!",
    "You think I ''like'' that kind of pressure?! Being responsible for every little thing in Equestria ''and'' you?! What I'd like is a [booming] ''sister I can depend on!''",
    "[booming] ''Calm down, Luna!''",
    "''Fine!'' I just remembered something I forgot I always wanted to do. Be alone!",
    "Who needs a gloomy sister moping around all the time anyway? [whinnies]",
    "Now, was it two left turns and a right, or two right turns and a left?[whoosh!]",
    "Luna always handled directions.[twig snaps][chicken clucks]",
    "[shakily] And scared away the chickens!",
    "Oh! Heh. I thought climbing Mount Filly-mane-jaro was on ''my'' list.",
    "Ah. I'm, uh, here for the moonset.[beat]",
    "So, uh, how did the rest of your day go?",
    "Yeah. Me... too. Mmm.",
    "Oh, well... [scoffs] Since we're going the same way. [laughs]",
    "The night's pretty special, too.",
    "and",
    "[laughs] Hope I wasn't too bossy doing it.",
    "I ''do'' know. [sighs] And I wouldn't trade you for any of the adventures on my list.",
    "Not even my zip line.",
    "It's not always easy being the big sister either. I'm sorry, too.",
    "Now, where have I seen ''that'' before?",
    "and",
    "You think maybe Twilight's having trouble with the amulet?",
    "My... \"ones-versary\"?",
    "You're not the ''only'' ones. What did you have in mind?",
    "[giggling happily] Mind? Oh! Of course not! Oh! I think a play is a fantastic idea!",
    "Oh, uh, forgive me for getting so excited. It's just, when I was a filly, my friends often put on plays. [sighs] It was so wonderful. Everypony coming together to create a magical experience to share with others. I've always believed theater brings out the best in us and forges a special bond of friendship.",
    "Oh, not me. I was always too busy with my magic lessons to be part of any plays myself. But still, it's something I always wished I could experience.",
    "You want me to star in your play?!",
    "Twilight.",
    "Your invitation is very kind, but are you certain it's wise? I have no acting experience at all.",
    "Well, if you're sure...",
    "Then I would be delighted to join your theater troupe![squeak]",
    "Oh! Uh, right! Of course! Heh. [clears throat] [quietly] It is time for a new day in Equestria.",
    "Oh, uh, I said [quietly] it is time for a new day in Equestria.[beat]",
    "Oh, yes, yes. My Royal Canterlot Voice. Thank you for the reminder, Twilight. [booming] ''It is time for a new day in Equestria!''[birds squawking]",
    "Oh! Goodness! This theater does have strong acoustics. M-My apologies. I'm still learning to hone my craft.",
    "[flat and stilted] It is time for a new day in Equestria-aaa.",
    "[rushed and hyperactive] It's time for a new day in Equestria! [normal] Uh, how was that?",
    "[with wildly varying tone] Come on, Star Swirl. Throw off that must-Y hat and let's have a... a dance![clanking]",
    "Oh, dear. I think we have a problem!",
    "You want to give ''me'' acting lessons?",
    "Thank you so much, Twilight! This is what I always knew theater must be about \u2013 that special stage pony bond of shared trust and honesty.",
    "The pleasure is all mine! If there's anything I can do to become a better Equestrian thespian, I will! What do you have planned?",
    "What box?",
    "Should I get you a blanket?",
    "It is? But I don't see anything.",
    "Mmmm... nothing. Oh! The classroom floor under my hooves! Does that count?[clunk][teleportation zap]",
    "My love for Equestria and all the ponies in it! Twilight, you felt what I was emoting, didn't you?",
    "Twilight, if you honestly thought I was a bad actress, why didn't you tell me?",
    "I'm not upset because you insulted my acting.",
    "I'm upset because, in all the time we've known each other, I thought I taught you about the importance of friendship, trust, and honesty!",
    "I'm afraid I haven't much to say, Twilight.",
    "You really mean that?",
    "[sighs] You had good intentions, Twilight. But you know that the truth is always better than a well-meant lie. Didn't Applejack remind you?",
    "Well... I don't know about that. Isn't there an old saying? \"The show must go on\"? There may be a way for us to save the play yet.",
    "No. But I ''am'' a princess.[crowd booing]",
    "Fortunately, ''I'' know a thing or two about how to deal with those.",
    "Yes. But let's celebrate later. Right now, we have a show to do!",
    "No longer in that role. Rarity, Applejack, Pinkie, Twilight, go calm the audience. Let them know the play will start in just a minute.[teleportation zap]",
    "Rainbow Dash, bring us some clouds and place them behind the stage. There, that's our new backdrop. Starlight, do you have a copy of the script?[magic zap]",
    "Spike, you narrate the play. Fluttershy will be our new lead.",
    "Visualize with me. You're a princess. Regal. Commanding. Confident. Feel the rising sun's warmth. Equestria needs you.",
    "[whispering] Spike! Improvise!",
    "We play charades.[crowd ooh-ing and ahh-ing][crowd cheering]",
    "Judging by how many flowers the audience threw, it seems our play was a success.",
    "You shouldn't. I never felt I had to be ''on stage'' to be a part of the show. All I ever wanted was to share an honest bond of creativity, artistry, and happiness with my friends. And that's exactly what I got to do.",
    "You're welcome, Twilight. But from now on, none of you will have to call me \"Princess\" anymore.",
    "No. I had so much fun tonight, I've decided to give up my crown, step down from the throne, and devote all of my time to the theater!",
    "Gotcha! Maybe I'm not such a bad actress after all.",
    "Sorry to interrupt. We know you're busy planning the Summer Sun Celebration as we requested. But...",
    "Of course not. It's just that the Celebration has always been about us. My defeat of Luna...",
    "Now that we're leaving, we don't see a need for the holiday any longer.",
    "My sister and I have decided. The time for us to retire is upon us. You and your friends have proven you are ready to lead Equestria. So let this be the last Summer Sun Celebration as Equestria leaves behind the old to embrace the new!",
    "Twilight, we know you had, uh, [laughs] difficulties using the amulet to raise the sun and moon. We thought perhaps a practice session before the festivities might be in order.",
    "Spoken like a true leader. How can we help?",

    "Very well. I'll forget Twilight's \"punishment\" on one condition.",

    "Your friend Spike made me aware that you were letting your fears get the best of you. I commend him for taking your feelings seriously. Now, if you will all excuse me, I must return to Canterlot. I'm expecting some mail.",

    "Actually, there is. The EEA guidebook is very specific about how to run a school.",
    "Of course not. You've never run a school before. The Equestria Education Association is a board of learned ponies that oversee every school in Equestria.",
    "Not even a princess can do whatever she likes when it comes to shaping young pony minds. The EEA ensures that whether it's unicorns studying magic, Pegasi learning weather, or Earth ponies researching agriculture, all schools are held to the same high standard. They'll need to approve your plan before you can move forward.",
    "I've always wondered what happened to Star Swirl. This is quite a discovery, Sunburst.",
    "It appears so.",
    "My Olde Ponish is a bit rusty, but I wonder if the answers can be found somewhere within the pages of this book.",

    "And what about you, dear? Fluttershy, is it?",
    "I understand from Twilight Sparkle's letters that you enjoy tending to the needs of woodland creatures.",
    "As do I. As Princess, I care deeply about all creatures, great and small.[cough]",
    "Nothing means more to me than the well-being of all my subjects.",
    "Ah, Philomena, my pet. You're awake. Do say hello to our gracious hosts.",
    "She is quite a sight, isn't she?",
    "Really? Well, if I must... I'm sorry, everypony. I'm afraid I have to cut the party short. The mayor has requested an audience with me. Royal duty calls. Thank you for a wonderful time. It's been a joy getting to know you all better.",

    "Oh, stop fooling around, Philomena. You're scaring everypony.[ponies gasp and awe]",
    "This ''is'' Philomena. She's quite a sight, as I said. But nothing unusual for a phoenix. Isn't that right, Philomena?",
    "A phoenix is a majestic and magical bird. While it appears healthy and happy most of the time, every so often it must renew itself by shedding all of its feathers and bursting into flame. [whispering] Rather melodramatic, if you ask me. [normal voice] It then rises from the ashes, fresh as a daisy. All just a normal part of the life cycle of a phoenix. I'm afraid mischievous little Philomena here took the occasion to have a little fun with you, Fluttershy. Say you're sorry, young lady.",
    "Of course not, my little pony. Where on Earth would you get such an idea?",
    "And I do appreciate that your heart was in the right place, child. But all you had to do was ask me and I could have told you Philomena was a phoenix and saved you all this trouble.",
    "No, that's quite all right. I think I can remember.",
    "The Crystal Empire has returned.",

    "''Didn't I''?",
    "It's beautiful.",
    "Twilight, as I understand it, Spike brought Princess Cadance the Crystal Heart because you weren't sure how quickly you could find a way to escape the tower. You weren't willing to risk the future of the citizens of the Crystal Empire in an effort to guarantee your own.

    "and",
    "Oh, hello, Starlight. I don't know about you, but I feel very well-rested. Where's Luna?",
    "Did she now? It seems my duties were harder than my sister expected.",
    "Moon raised! It's even easier than raising the sun. [chuckles] What's next?",
    "Of course. Everypony's asleep at night. Heh. Luna works alone... Oh, but it's nothing I can't handle. All I have to do is watch over Equestria, visit the dream realm, and protect ponies in their nightmares. My list was three times as long! [chuckles][lightswitches clicking]",
    "All right. Everypony's asleep. You're talking to yourself, Celestia. Heh. But there's nopony else to talk to! [chuckles] Yet. I can talk to ponies in their dreams![vooooom][whimsical music]",
    "Now, to save some ponies from their nightmares. Which aren't real, so it shouldn't be too hard, right? Right. Good call, Celestia! And I'm talking to myself again.",
    "Starlight! I'm here now. Tell me what's wrong.",
    "Don't worry, Starlight. I know how to handle Nightmare Moon.",
    "This can't be!",
    "No! I'll never turn into you!",
    "That's not true! Even when we were apart, I knew I needed her!",
    "''Enough!''",
    "and",
    "It's Starlight Glimmer's. She's afraid this is what will happen if we continue to fight!",
    "But my magic isn't powerful enough! I thought if we worked together...!",
    "Oh, Luna, I can't do this! I was wrong! Your job is so incredibly hard! You have to battle nightmares and work in the darkness and do it all alone! It takes such a brave, strong pony to do what you do!",
    "No, you're not! You are not real, and you will never exist ''again!''",
    "Only because you were here. I don't know how you do this alone.",
    "Um, a little.",
    "and",
    "Oh! Heh. H-How... eh, nice. Ahem. [chews, gags, gulps] They're... delicious. Heh. Thank you.",

    "Oh, maybe wait until after the coronation. Twilight doesn't need anything else to worry about today.",
    "And while you united these three villains, ''you'' pretended to be Grogar?!",
    "You have made a grave misjudgment, Discord. Do you have anything else you'd like to tell us?!",
    "Twilight, Luna, we need to make a plan. Maybe it's not too late to stop this disaster from happening!",
    "Twilight, it doesn't matter if Discord set up your successes or not. We believe in you and always have.",

    ", and",
    "Ready, sister?",
    "and",
    "and",

    "There is no doubt that Tirek is after Alicorn magic.",
    "We must rid ourselves of our magic before Tirek has the chance to steal it from us.",
    "We do not believe that Tirek is aware that a fourth Alicorn princess exists in Equestria. If we transfer our magic to you, Tirek will not know where it has gone.",
    "I'm sorry, Princess Twilight, but you must keep your new abilities a secret. I fear that your friends being aware of your new power could put them at great risk. Do you still think you can take on this responsibility?",
    "Then we must begin at once.[magic noises][wibbling noise]",
    "[out of breath] It is done.[owl hoots]",
    "You will not prevail, Tirek.",
    "I believe it is yours, Princess Twilight.",
    "You've been wondering what you are meant to do as a princess. Do you know now?",
    "Then it is unlikely you are meant to take on this task alone.",
    "You are now Twilight Sparkle, the princess of friendship. But what is the princess of friendship without her friends?",
    "Please, everycreature! If you can just explain what happened...",
    "Find the students quickly, Twilight, or I fear our world will be at war!",
    "Twilight! I was so relieved to get your letter!",
    "Hold on, please! I'm sure Princess Twilight Sparkle has a good explanation for all of this.",
    "I seem to recall something about Earth ponies, unicorns, and Pegasi doing something similar, don't you?",
    "[voice over] As you know, the ancient castle that I once shared with Princess Luna lies mostly in ruins, deep in the Everfree Forest. But if you look carefully, you may find a book that could prove helpful to your research, hidden somewhere in what's left of the castle library.",
    "Indeed you do.",
    "Twilight Sparkle, my faithful student. I knew you could do it.",
    "I told you that you needed to make some friends, nothing more. I saw the signs of Nightmare Moon's return, and I knew it was you who had the magic inside to defeat her, but you could not unleash it until you let true friendship into your heart. Now if only another will as well. Princess Luna!",
    "It has been a thousand years since I have seen you like this. Time to put our differences behind us. We were meant to rule together, little sister.",
    "Will you accept my friendship?",
    "I've missed you, too.",
    "Why so glum, my faithful student? Are you not happy that your quest is complete and you can return to your studies in Canterlot?",
    "Spike, take a note, please. ''I, Princess Celestia, hereby decree that the unicorn Twilight Sparkle shall take on a new mission for Equestria. She must continue to study the magic of friendship. She must report to me her findings from her new home in Ponyville.''[ponies cheer]",
    "Mares and gentlecolts, we are gathered here today to witness the union of [muffled] Princess Mi Amore Cadenza and Shining Armor.",
    "Princess Cadance and Shining Armor, it is my great pleasure to pronounce you\u2013",
    "No. You won't. You may have made it impossible for Shining Armor to perform his spell, but now that you have so foolishly revealed your true self, I can protect my subjects from you!",
    "The Elements of Harmony. You must get to them and use their power to defeat the queen.",
    "Don't worry about me. I'm fine. You have a real wedding to put together.",
    "Mares and gentlecolts, we are gathered here today to celebrate the union of the ''real'' Princess Mi Amore Cadenza\u2013",
    "Hm. The union of Princess Cadance and Shining Armor. The strength of their commitment is clear. The power of their love, undeniable. May we have the rings please? I now pronounce you mare and colt![cheering]",
    "This is your victory as much as theirs. You persisted in the face of doubt, and your actions led to your being able to bring the real Princess Cadance back to us. ''Learning to trust your instincts is a valuable lesson to learn.''",
    "Rainbow Dash, that's your cue.[explosion]",
    "Yes?",
    "[gasp] Find Princess Cadance and Shining Armor.",
    "''My dearest Twilight, you must come to Canterlot at once.''{{squarebrackets|[[theme song]]}}",
    "Yes. Princess Cadance and Shining Armor are already there. The others will be joining them soon.",
    "She will succeed at her task. And when she does, we'll know that she is that much closer to being ready.",
    "Trust me, little sister.",
    "This is a different kind of test. The Crystal Empire has returned.",
    "There wouldn't be. Few remember it ever existed at all. Even my knowledge of the Empire is limited. But what I do know is that it contains a powerful magic. One thousand years ago, King Sombra, a unicorn whose heart was black as night, took over the Crystal Empire.",
    "He was ultimately overthrown, turned to shadow, and banished to the ice of the arctic north.",
    "But not before he was able to put a curse upon the Empire. A curse that caused it to vanish into thin air. If the Empire is filled with hope and love, those things are reflected across all of Equestria. If hatred and fear take hold... Which is why I need your help finding a way to protect it.",
    "It is, as I said, a different kind of test. But one I'm certain you will pass.",
    "By joining Princess Cadance and Shining Armor in the Crystal Empire.",
    "He is. And your Ponyville friends will join you there as well. I have every confidence you will succeed. And when you do, I'll know you are ready to move on to the next level of your studies.",
    "You won't.",
    "You ''won't''. But Twilight, in the end, it must be you and you alone who ultimately assists Princess Cadance and Shining Armor in doing what needs to be done to protect the Empire. Do you understand?",
    "Then go. There is no time to lose.",
    "With the return of Sombra, Princess Luna and I felt it was time to reinforce the castle's defenses.",
    "So ''I'' asked our old Captain of the Guard to handle the job.",
    "I will represent their authority. And thank you, Twilight. Your help will reveal if there are any holes in our security.",
    "I am sorry, Twilight, but it looks as though Shining Armor has truly won the crown.",
    "[clears throat] [forced] I, uh, apologize, for not listening to your concerns, sister. It seems we need to make adjustments to account for threats ''inside'' the castle as well as out. If you agree?",
    "Twilight Sparkle.",
    "You have a very special gift. I don't think I've ever come across a unicorn with your raw abilities.",
    "But you need to learn to tame these abilities through focused study.",
    "Twilight Sparkle, I'd like to make you my own personal prot\u00e9g\u00e9 here at the school.",
    "Well?",
    "One other thing, Twilight.",
    "Having all four of us in the Empire to greet them lets the dignitaries know that their visit is considered an important one.",
    "Your time will come.[can clanking]",
    "[gasps]",
    "I've just had the most terrible dream.",
    "Then we haven't much time. The stronger ''he'' becomes, the more we are ''all'' in danger.[pages turning]",
    "[narrating] Tirek and his brother Scorpan came here from a distant land, intent on stealing Equestrian magic. But Scorpan soon came to appreciate the ways of Equestria, even befriending a young unicorn wizard.",
    "[narrating] Scorpan returned to his own land, and Tirek was sent to Tartarus for his crimes. But it appears he has found a way to escape.",
    "His time in Tartarus left him very weak. He has just now gained enough strength to use his dark powers.",
    "No, Twilight. I'm afraid I must call in another to stop Tirek. Discord.",
    "I'm afraid I put too much trust in Discord and the effect that friendship would have upon him.[crowd gasps]",
    "Tirek has stolen enough magic that he now has the strength to steal flight as well. Without Pegasi to control the weather, there will be no rain in Equestria. There is word he has gone after Earth ponies as well. Without their strength, they will not be able to tend the land.",
    "There is no doubt that Tirek is after Alicorn magic. With Discord by his side, we will not be able to stop him from taking it.",
    "But there is one solution. It is only by making this sacrifice that Equestria and the lands beyond it might be saved. We must rid ourselves of our magic before Tirek has the chance to steal it from us.",
    "Well, it has been over a thousand years. Will you stay here and teach magic once again? My sister and I have such fond memories of your lessons.",
    "[giggles]",
    "Then I hope you will return to Canterlot on occasion and share the wisdom of your great experience with the next generation of ponies.",
    "[echoing] Congratulations, Twilight. I knew you could do it.",
    "You did something today that's never been done before. Something even a great unicorn like Star Swirl the Bearded was not able to do, because he did not understand friendship like you do. The lessons you've learned here in Ponyville have taught you well. You have proven that you're ready, Twilight.",
    "That's because she ''is'' a princess.",
    "Since you've come to Ponyville, you've displayed the charity, compassion, devotion, integrity, optimism, and of course, the leadership of a true princess.",
    "Not in the same way as before. I'll still be here to help and guide you, but we're all ''your'' students now, too. You are an inspiration to us all, Twilight.",
    "[giggles] There will be time for all of that later.",
    "We are gathered here today in celebration of a momentous occasion. My most faithful student, Twilight Sparkle, has done many extraordinary things since she's lived in Ponyville. She even helped reunite me with my sister, Princess Luna. But today, Twilight Sparkle did something extraordinary. She created new magic, proving without a doubt that she is ready to be crowned Equestria's newest princess. Fillies and gentlecolts, may I present for the very first time, Princess Twilight Sparkle!{{#lstBehold, Princess Twilight Sparkle|song}}[crowd cheering]",
    "Say something, Princess.",
    "Thorax, as the new leader of the changelings, I look forward to discussing how we can improve our relationship in the future. However, for the moment, perhaps it is best that we leave the Changeling Kingdom to the changelings.",
    "[scream]",
    "Twilight Sparkle, my prized pupil.",
    "So lovely to see you again, as well as your friends.[crash]",
    "Ah, what is this? Oh ho ho, these creatures are adorable.",
    "I'm terribly honored that you and the good citizens of Ponyville have organized a parade in honor of my visit.",
    "Unfortunately, that visit is going to have to wait for another time. I'm afraid an emergency has come up in Fillydelphia. Apparently there's been some sort of ''infestation''.",
    "Yes, a swarm of incredibly bothersome creatures has invaded the poor town. I'm sorry Twilight, to have to put you all through so much trouble.",
    "Before I have to go, would you care to give me your latest report on the magic of friendship in person?",
    "Haven't you learned anything about friendship?",
    "I'm so proud of you, Twilight Sparkle, and I'm very impressed with your friends as well. It sounds like you're all learning so much from each other.",
    "Find Twilight! We may not have our magic, but we aren't completely helpless! We'll hold them off as long as we can!",
    "There isn't a punishment worthy of all you've done!",
    "When I sent you to Ponyville, I had high hopes. When you became Princess of Friendship, I knew I made the right choice. But nothing could prepare me for how proud I am right now. Equestria is definitely in the right hooves. You are ready.",
    "We really are both just so proud of you. If you need a moment, that's all right. It is ''your'' coronation.[trumpet fanfare]",
    "Very well. [to audience] Citizens of Equestria and beyond![crowd cheering][yaks stomping][dragons breathing fire]",
    "My sister and I have ruled this land for quite some time, but even ''we'' know that change eventually comes to us all. And though we know it can be unsettling, it's as natural as the rising and setting of the sun and the moon. Both of which my sister and I feel confident leaving in the hooves of the pony who will come after us.",
    "And so without further ado, I give you the new ruler of Equestria - Princess Twilight Sparkle!",
    "[gasps][crowd gasps]",
    "And what a wonderful decree it is!",
    "We know Equestria is in the perfect hooves with you ''and'' your friends looking out for it. And while we'll always be here if you need us, it's time for us to be on our way.",
    "But now it's time for you to rule on your own. You're all more than capable.",

    "I am very impressed, princess.",
    "And you did a wonderful job of it. You ''and'' your friends.",
    "And I'm sure you won't.",
    "No need for ''that'' now, Princess Twilight.",
    "[giggles] No need to apologize.",
    "I must admit that it is wonderful to actually be looking forward to the Summer Sun Celebration.",
    "For my subjects, it has always been a celebration of my defeat of Nightmare Moon. But for me... [sighs] It was just a terrible reminder that I'd had to banish my own sister.",
    "But now it has become a wonderful reminder of her transformation back into Princess Luna, and our happy reunion. I am so pleased that you will be playing a role in the festivities. I know it must have been difficult to see your friends return to Ponyville without you.",
    "You may no longer be my student, Princess Twilight, but I hope you know that I will always be here if you need me. Just as I hope that you will always be there when I need you.",
    "A letter from Ponyville, I presume?",
    "I'll leave you to it.",
    "[gasps] [yelps]",
    "It is time for us... to retire!",
    "With the help of your friends, of course.",
    "Twilight, you must go! Defend Equestria, and we shall contain the forest.",
    "I see you've made yourselves at home.",
    "You're right.",
    "About ''one'' thing. A good leader knows when to ask for help, but a ''great'' leader has the courage to admit when they've made a mistake and the strength to make it right. Today, you've proven to me beyond any doubt that you will be a great leader.",
    "Luna and I have decided it may have been a bit unfair to thrust this upon you without giving you the time you need to prepare.",
    "It will. But when she's ready.",
    ", and",
    "Sounds to me that an important lesson was learned.",
    "Fall is one of my favorite seasons, so I came to celebrate the Running of the Leaves.",
    "That's all right, Applejack. ''Anypony can get swept up in the excitement of competition.''",
    "Exactly, Twilight. Now, unfortunately, because the two of you were busy tricking each other instead of shaking down leaves, many of the lovely trees of Equestria are still covered.",
    "I must say, it's been very nice having you take over some of the planning responsibilities for this year's Gala.",
    "Thank you, Twilight. I am quite looking forward to just enjoying the Gala for once.[fanfare]",
    "[giggles]",
    "I'm afraid not!",
    "You have ''nothing'' to apologize for. This has been the most fun Gala in years!",

    "Actually, we just need a few days to put together a little ceremony.",
    "Everything you've gone through over the years has been a training program.",
    "We have the utmost confidence in you.",
    "Oh, Twilight. How disappointing.",
    "I realize the game of buckball traditionally requires an Earth pony, a Pegasus, and a unicorn, but I appreciate you allowing my students to compete.",
    "Indeed, though not as well as your team. [echoing] COME ON, SCHOOL OF MAGIC!",
    "I'm glad to see such good sportsponyship on display. Your cheer squad was an inspiration, Rainbow Dash. I'll have to start one at my school as well.",
    "Nicely done.",
    "Throughout our city, ponies have been reporting tales of their magic failing. Spells going wrong. Potions not working.",
    "Ah! It is even more terrible than we feared! Magic is disappearing all across Equestria![ponies gasp]",
    "Star Swirl believes the power will drain from our land in three days. First, unicorn magic and spells will fail.",
    "On the second day, creatures will lose their magic abilities.",
    "And finally, magical artifacts will stop working. When the sun sets on the third day, the magic in our world will be gone forever![ponies gasp]",

    "Thank you, Twilight. Thank you, all.",
    "Follow me.",
    "I've called you here for a matter of great importance. It seems an old foe of mine, someone I thought I had defeated long ago, has returned. His name... is Discord.",
    "Discord is the mischievous spirit of disharmony. Before my sister and I stood up to him, he ruled Equestria in an eternal state of unrest and unhappiness. Luna and I saw how miserable life was for Earth ponies, Pegasi, and unicorns alike, so after discovering the Elements of Harmony, we combined our powers and rose up against him, turning him to stone.",
    "I thought the spell we cast would keep him contained forever, but since Luna and I are no longer connected to the Elements, the spell has been broken.",
    "This is Canterlot Tower, where the Elements are kept inside since all of you recovered them. I need you to wield the Elements of Harmony once again and stop Discord before he thrusts all of Equestria into eternal chaos.",
    "You six showed the full potential of the Elements by harnessing the magic of your friendship to beat a mighty foe. Although Luna and I once wielded the Elements, it is you who now control their power, and it is you who must defeat Discord!",
    "Have no fear, ponies. I have total confidence that you will be able to defeat Discord with these!",
    "That chamber is protected by a powerful spell that only I can break! This doesn't make sense!",
    "Discord... Show yourself!",
    "Enough! What have you done with the Elements of Harmony?",
    "You'll never get away with this, Discord!",
    "Stop stalling, Discord! What have you done with the Elements of Harmony?",
    "Good luck, my little ponies. The fate of Equestria is in your hooves.",

    "[voiceover] That's right, my little ponies. Me and my family were pilgrim pony folk, back when I was a little filly. Oh, we ventured far and wide, collecting new seeds and sellin' the old. But my pa was the finest seed collector in all of Equestria. Then, one day, the Smith family found themselves in the most brilliant, most grand, most magnificent of all cities. A place called... Canterlot. Well, I bet your hooves to hindquarters I had never seen anything like it before nor since. And as if the beauty of that city wasn't enough, suddenly, ''she'' appeared. Princess Celestia, the most regal of all ponies. When lo and behold, she stopped to look at my pa's seed collection. Then Princess Celestia saw that we were plumb-tuckered and hankerin' to find our forever home. And bein' a royal Princess and all, she knew exactly the place for us to lay down our stakes. My pa gave the Princess a mighty thanks. We quickly found that land near the Everfree Forest, and we built our first home. Next, we planted our first orchards. But an orchard don't grow overnight, and we were getting mighty short on food. Now mind you, we were cautioned about the forest, and we knew that it was not fit to enter.[timberwolf howling]",
    "[voiceover] But I knew there was critters livin' there. There must be somethin' to eat. It was dark and musty, and I won't lie, it was scary. But every inch was covered in plant life, and before I knew it, wasn't I standin' in front of the most incredible apple trees! I had never seen anything that bore this kind of colorful fruit! Oh I started picking apples quick as a whip![timberwolves howling and growling]",
    "[voiceover] I turned, and there before me stood the timberwolves! I've never run so fast in my life. I did the only thing I could think of.[pot banging]",
    "[voiceover] My pa and I planted those special apple seeds, and before our eyes they grew like wildfire. Why, we had full grown trees faster than you could say 'lickety split'. Then each year, I paid close attention to the signs of the zap apples' special harvesting times\u2014how the weather affects the Everfree Forest, how the timberwolves howl when the zap apples first start growing, and how they zapped away if you didn't pick 'em all in one day! And the fruits of our labor were the best fruit we ever tasted. Soon enough I was mixing up batches of zap apple jam. Just like harvestin' the zap apples had its special rules, so did makin' zap apple jam. I learned that you gotta be extra friendly with the bees, otherwise their honey won't taste rightly sweet to mix in with the zap apples. Who'd'a thought that glass jars needed talkin' to? Or that zap apples like pink polka dots? But magic is as magic does. Just funny that way. Then ponies started comin' to our farm from far and wide just to get a taste of my zap apple jam. Some of them decided to stay, like Stinkin' Rich, Diamond Tiara's great grandfather. Matter of fact, the first thing he ever sold was my zap apple jam.[train whistle blowing]",

    "That'd be your Great-Great-Auntie Applesauce when she was just about your age. Now, she used to go by another name, but everypony started calling her Applesauce after half her teeth fell out when she was makin' apple jam. Yeah. Never did find them teeth in all those jars.",

    "And, of course, we can't forget to take the big family photo! We always snapped a photo in front of the barn at the end of every reunion, let's us see how our family's grown!",
    "Indeedy, and I'm lookin' forward to makin' more at this one. Oh, I'm sure everypony is, and I do mean everypony! We got the whole family together this time 'round! Who knows if they'll all be able to make the next one?",

    "Applejack, you had us so caught up in all the doin', we haven't had a second to enjoy the company of the folks we've been doin' it with!",
    "Oh, hey now... everypony's still here, ain't they? Still plenty of time to make good memories! You've just got to give everypony a chance to actually make 'em.",

    "Yeah, just a couple.",
    "Ohohoh, that's a good one.",
    "[laughing]",
    "Why, the way you were a-hoopin' and a-hoppin' and kickin' and spinnin' reminded me of when I was a spry young filly. Guh, charley horse, charley horse! Ooh, that's better.",
    "[laughing]",
    "Oh-ho, sugarcube. [laughing] Your big sister lied so much when she was a filly, the whole family ended up in the hospital.",
    "When Applejack and Big Mac were just a wee bit older than you are now, they both kept a-squabblin' over who would run the farm better.",
    "You two horned toads better stop jabberin' and get to workin'! Yeah, they'd better. I need you to go to town. The apple blight's been awful, and if we don't get more spray, {{Htitle|replaced with \"juice\" in Netflix version|cider}} season'll be shorter than a dwarf crabapple tree!",
    "See what?",

    "Mm, meh-enh. Besides, {{Htitle|replaced with \"juice\" in Netflix version|cider}}-makin' is iffy business. And we're probably not gonna have a lot this year anyway, what with all the blight. I am sorry, Applejack, but you's just gonna have to ''un''-promise.",
    "[grunts] Yeah, I'll go take a look. [mutters]",

    "It was my second year here in Ponyville. Uh, they was before I had the rick on the one knee.",
    "Dropped my second best teeth right in the pigpen, and that was the worst case of apple blight I have ever seen!",

[to Filthy Rich] And don't ''you'' go gettin' any ideas about cuttin' ties with Sweet Apple Acres, or I'm goin' right to your grandpappy. Get me?",

    "[laughs] Well, my guests may be looking for lights, music, and parties, but working hard and making friends is how I turned this hotel into what it is today, and how I plan to make it even bigger.

    "Yeah, I suppose you're right. Flim's such a showpony, and Flam has such a head for business. Why, if they ever did work together, they'd be running this place in two shakes! Ah, speaking of which, I'd better get back to work. Y'all enjoy your stay now, you hear?",

    "[snorts] Impossibly Rich, what an honor it is to have you at my humble five-hoof resort. I'm sure Flam has done an excellent job showing you around, but nothing could beat a personalized tour from the mane himself. Uh-huh-huh.",

You're the only ponies to ever figure out the secret to my success. Takes a lot of work keepin' everypony fightin'. But as long as I keep 'em convinced that I'm their ''only'' friend, all of Las Pegasus will be mine. Oh, you can't trick a confession out of a pony like me! I'm ''always'' one step ahead.",

    "[deadpan] This way.",
    "[deadpan] No. ''This'' way.",
    "[deadpan] I know you did it out of love. You're my best sister friend forever.",

    "[deadpan] What do you think, Boulder?",
    "[deadpan] Mm-hmm.",
    "[deadpan] Mm-hmm. This doesn't mean we need to start talking about feelings, does it?",
    "[deadpan] Maybe after this we could decorate my new place.",

    "I saw that the Tantabus had grown more powerful, but I did not realize that power was enough to enable it to escape my dreams. If its power grows, it could very well find a way to escape into the real world. It could turn all of Equestria into a living nightmare!",
    "Good. As you six slumber here, I will pursue the creature into whichever of your dreams it infests.",
    "There is nothing my sister can do. She has no power in the realm of sleep. Only I can move from dream to dream. I am afraid nopony can help me tonight.",

    "As long as none of you dreamt about another pony, the Tantabus remains confined to your dreams. I still have a chance to catch it before it's too late.",

    "It is true. With so many dreams to hide in, I do not know how I can catch it.",
    "I... ''can'' create shared dreams, yes, but for so many ponies at once? I have never done anything like that. The amount of power it would take...",
    "Of course. I will do anything to end this, including accept your help. I cannot allow the Tantabus to escape into the real world. All of you must now go back to sleep and hope that I can create such a dream.",

    "And if they're not, this rare opportunity to focus on their friendship will certainly bring them closer. Unless...",

    "Indeed. How would Twilight nurse me back to health if she were sick too? You will be letting me stay at your place until I'm all better, won't you?",
    "But taking in the sick and the desperate - isn't that what Fluttershy would do? Isn't 'helping' something that friends do for friends? Unless, of course, you're really saying that you're ''not'' my friend.",

    "Carry me?",

    "There is one way...",

    "[chuckles] Better. Oh! I'll need napkins. I'll simply make them... ah, well, I could... or... No. I've got nothing. How do I make these better? What should I do? Make them... [gasps, snaps fingers] Make them glow! Oh, that's not good enough for Fluttershy. Should I make them fly? Glow, fly, and [chuckles] and fold! Glow, fly, fold into fun shapes, perhaps?",
    "Pinkie Pie! Just the pony I need. [snaps fingers] As ''the'' party pony and Fluttershy's close \u2013 but not best \u2013 friend, I need your advice. I'm hosting a tea party for her, and it has to be perfect. No! It has to be even ''better'' than perfect!",

    "That bad?",
    "I was trying to make the tea party different and special like me. But all I did was make it chaotic and weird... like me. What if those ponies at the tea shop and the china shop were right? What if Fluttershy sees how crazy this place is and realizes how different we are? And then doesn't want to be friends anymore?! [hyperventilating]",
    "What to do, what to do, what to do... Oh![bonk, bonk, bonk, bonk, bonk!]",
    "Got it! We know Fluttershy, and we know what she likes. First of all, we need to get rid of all the new stuff.",
    "Enjoy your all-expense-paid trip around Equestria![poof!]",
    "Well done, everybody, but there's still more work to do.",
    "We need to make this place ''more'' Fluttershy and less, well, me.[poof!]",
    "One thing I know about my dear friend is that she loves comfy chairs. But ''not'' on the ceiling. [snaps fingers][poof!]",
    "And I'm almost certain she likes stairs...[poof!]",
    "...that lead ''somewhere''.[poof!][stretch, whip!]",
    "And although we've never discussed it, I'm pretty sure Fluttershy likes gravity. [snaps fingers][crash!]",
    "Okay, fellas! This is a good start, but stand back. Let me show you how it's done. We just need some of this. [snaps fingers][poof!]",
    "And a little of that. [snaps fingers][poof!]",

    "G-Greetings, friend. Please do come in.",

    "But the weather today is particularly nice. ...As I previously mentioned. Would you care for some milk toast?",
    "Whatever do you mean?",
    "Oh, dear Fluttershy, worry not. I can assure you that for the first time, I'm feeling perfectly normal. Now, let me top you off.[clatter!]",
    "Oops! Butterfingers! How embarrassing.[fizzle]",
    "I have... no idea.",
    "Oh, you don't say... Have you read any good books lately? [chuckles nervously]",

    "''This'' is what you were hoping for? But this is the complete opposite of your tea parties.",
    "I know. I was afraid that if you saw exactly how different we are, you wouldn't want to be friends anymore.",

    "You do?",

    "No? Nothing?",
    "Well, I don't know about the rest of you, but I feel we've been pretty exhaustive in our attempts to recreate every single detail of our previous encounter.",
    "Well, perhaps we should have another look at the data we've collected. [gasps] Of course! There ''is'' one last variable that we haven't accounted for.",
    "You!",
    "You weren't there observing us. No matter how hard we try, we can't possibly recreate our weekend of fun exactly as it happened because you'll always be watching, and you weren't there.",
    "It has only served to prove that moments of levity and bonding between friends simply cannot be recreated so that others might share in the experience.",
    "[laughing]",
    "Hi, Twilight! The gang mentioned we'd all be hanging out together today![liquid pouring]",
    "Yeah! The peanut-butter-hoof gang! [tapping]",
    "and",
    "Of course none of this would've happened if I hadn't encouraged everypony not to invite you this weekend.",
    "Well, I didn't think that they should interrupt you. But now I see that we should have. Oh, I feel just terrible.",
    "Better?",
    "Of course not. That whole jealousy thing was just a happy accident.[magic zap]",
    "Certainly we can all agree that Princess Twilight learned a valuable lesson here \u2013 that even ''she'' can have feelings of jealousy, that she should recognize said feelings rather than trying to pretend that she doesn't have them. Mm-hmm. Did I get the tiniest bit of glee out of watching her try to recreate our weekend of fun in the name of science? Oh, most definitely! But what's important here is that it was never my intent to make Twilight feel jealous. That's something that the ''old'' me would have tried to do. ''Orange'' you glad I've changed?[long beat]",
    "I said, ''Orange you glad I've changed?''[myriad thumps]",
    "Orange! Like the ones at the Applejack farm! I-I mean, from this weekend![beat]",
    "No? ''Nothing?'' Really? I thought you'd find this ''hisss-terical''![rattlesnake tail rattling]",
    "W-W-What's so funny?",
    "I-I-I don't get it. Somepony want to tell me what's so hilarious? Anypony? Hello?![magic zap]",

    "Oh, just a bit of light reading before I head off on my ''extremely'' important mission. I suppose you all know that I've been tasked to capture a certain escapee.",
    "You're right, Spike. It ''is'' a big deal. Seems I possess a magic that gives me quite an important role in Equestria. Maybe they should make ''me'' an Alicorn princess.[cheering offscreen]",
    "Mmwah! Mmwah!",
    "Oh, I never dream of such things. Ask Princess Luna.",
    "Yes, yes, yes, of course. It's just that I couldn't help but notice that Twilight hasn't yet opened this little chest of hers. I-I-It got me thinking, what if what's locked inside is something that could help her prove her royal worth? I only bring it up because she said that she's been feeling like her role as a princess doesn't equate to much.",
    "[mock sadness] Oh, my. Is eavesdropping not the way you're supposed to find out what your best pals are up to? Woe is me. Will I ever learn the intricate nuances of being a good friend?[beat]",
    "[clears throat] Well in any case, I suppose now is as good a time as any for me to make my exit.[engine starts]",
    "Oopsie-doopsie, I almost left with the little journal you've all been keeping. What a fascinating read. Haven't you girls just learned so much? I've bookmarked a few of the more interesting passages. You really should take a look! [to Fluttershy, hushed] We're still on for tea later, aren't we, Fluttershy?",
    "[singsong] Well, I'll bring the cucumber sandwiches...![door shuts]",

    "Surprise!",
    "I have done nothing of the sort!",
    "[laughing] Welcome to your lucky day, Rarity. You've found the one thing in Equestria that could rival my face for sheer beauty. What do you think? You like?",
    "[blows nose]",
    "[through mock tears] I hate goodbyes, don't you? I just go to pieces.[pop!]",
    "To fill in for Twilight, of course, as head-draconequus. I seem to recall a whole song about how this school is where you make your own rules. Now, who better at that than me?",
    "Really? I thought there must be some mistake.[flick]",
    "Well, I'm sure that she wouldn't mind a few tiny suggestions. [snaps fingers][flash]",

    "Nopony was at your desk. Imagine what Twilight would say. [imitating Twilight] Oh, how could you, Starlight?! You've broken my trust and failed me completely! [normal voice] Oh, don't worry. I'll cover for you. By the way, I hope you like Limburger cheese. I got a month's supply for the teacher's lounge. [snaps fingers][flash][crate opening]",
    "Oh! Some thanks for all my help. And after I hired all those substitute teachers for you.[splat]",
    "[sips]",
    "Its schedule was free.",

    "Oh, he did not! And what did you say?",

    "Friendship is about honesty. So believe me when I say... ''we're not stopping!'' [blows whistle]",
    "I wouldn't be so sure.",
    "''My'' problem? How is the fact that Twilight decided to put an incompetent, power-hungry unicorn in charge of her school ''my problem?!''",
    "Uh... [stuttering] I don't know what you're getting at.",
    "I accept! I mean, I-I-I suppose I can find some time in my busy schedule to help you out. But I will need my own office, expense account, parking space...",
    "But then we'd miss out on all those delightful misadventures.",
    "[snaps fingers] Everything is re-hidden.[rattling]",
    "[chuckles] Well, with a few surprises.[doors open]",
    "Oh, back so soon?",
    "Oh, poo! I just ordered business cards![credits]{{Transcripts}}{{Infobox Transcript}}[Previously on My Little Pony]",
    "[hushed] They took Fluttershy?",
    "Oh, this is so strange. We're here and that's there, and I clearly meant for us to be there and not here.",
    "Oh, well. If at first you don't succeed...",
    "[blows] A what?",
    "[laughs] Oh, that's adorable. But you see, unlike you, I can do anything.",
    "That's all very nice, but really a waste of time. We have me. And what else could we possibly need?",
    "Why are you here again? I mean, it's not like you're going to stop the changelings by pulling a rabbit out of a hat. At least ''my'' magic can ''do'' something.",
    "Like this! [snaps] For Fluttershy! Yaaah! [snaps]",
    "Well, that's a terrible plan. How are we even supposed to get to the hive?",
    "I haven't walked that far in a millennia!",
    "Oh, I don't know how any of you manage not being able to disappear and reappear whenever you want!",
    "Oh! Like a secret code! How about if I say \"we are\" and you say \"doomed\"? Or you say \"rescue\" and I say... [flails]",
    "Well, it's ''decent'' chaos. I don't know if I'd call it \"total\".",
    "Are we sure that I'll get my magic back when we destroy this throne thingy?",
    "[sarcastic] Well, that's reassuring.",
    "I don't suppose you brought any throne-destroying tools along with these useless sideshow props.",
    "Yes, but when the throne is destroyed, I'll be able to rip the very fabric of reality to save our friends, while ''you'll'' still be a self-absorbed, below-average illusionist!",
    "[defeated] Okay.",
    "[yawns] While I would love to sit around chitchatting about feeding and not feeding, [echoing] ''I have a Fluttershy to save!'' [echoes][changelings hissing]",
    "Oh, you keep saying that, but I haven't seen an actual changeling since we got into this hive.[distant humming]",
    "This seems like one of those moments where we need a plan.",
    "Not exactly great and powerful, but effective.",
    "Ugh. I really think we need a new code word!",
    "Normally, ''I'm'' the most distracting thing I can think of, but without magic...",
    "[taps microphone] Hello, changelings and changelettes! Believe me, I was just as surprised as you are that I'm here! When I heard that I'd be playing for a bunch of changelings, I was beside myself! Then I realized, it was just one of you.[rimshot][changelings snarl]",
    "[nervous laugh] But, seriously, this isn't the toughest crowd I've ever been in front of. But it's definitely the easiest to bug![rimshot]",

    "But you are obviously ''not'' Fluttershy!",

    "Oh, come on!",
    "Fluttershy?",
    "Splendid idea! Now who's ready for some celebratory tea at Fluttershy's?!",
    "So I'm able to rip the very fabric of reality again.",

    "''Good!''[dragging][thud]",

    "[giggles] We are gonna have so much more fun than them!",
    "Twilight, wait! Starlight has something for you!",
    "Well, every self-respecting magician has a disappearing act, so maybe we could start with that?",
    "No-no-no-no. The Great and Powerful Trrrrrixie goes big or not at all! Just tell me how you do it.",
    "Right. Like when you were so upset that cutie marks took away your friend, your magic was strong enough to enslave an entire village.[magic warbling]",
    "See? I'm already learning. If anypony is gonna teach me how to do a disappearing spell\u2014",
    "Whatever. I'm complimenting you. And me. We can do this, 'cause we're amazing, and magic is friendship and stuff.",
    "Spike! How about it?",
    "I mean it won't be as impressive, but okay. Teach away, mini-Twilight.",
    "Challenge accepted!",

    "[weakly] Ta-da.",
    "[clears throat] Teleport.",
    "Well, it was behind the apple. It was bound to happen. On the plus side, my magic is getting better! I made a whole table go poof! That was pretty impressive!",
    "We'll find it. No big deal.",
    "Teleport, like you told me to.[magic warbling]",
    "[scoffs] Well, gee, you probably should have told me all the steps before you let me do the spell.",
    "Oh, ''there'' you are! For a minute, I didn't think you were coming back, and that you might be upset with me for some weird reason. But then I remembered \u2013 you never get mad at me.",
    "Ooh, great question. I wish you'd asked it, like, right after I did the spell. I don't remember anymore.[magic warbling]",
    "Okay, that sounds fun. Ooh!",
    "Nope! But I did think we could stop for cinnamon nuts while we're out!",
    "Yes! I've been craving something sweet since I couldn't have any teacakes this morning.",
    "[chewing]",
    "Mmm, yes. I got them from the cart outside. They're delicious. Do you want some?",
    "Well, I cast a pretty amazing spell that transported it to the last place I was thinking of, but I might have been thinking about how I'd treat myself to a nice brooch instead.",
    "Sure!",
    "I'm still craving them. They'd go so well with cinnamon nuts!",
    "Darn. I could've sworn it'd be at the ice cream parlor, because it was warm in the castle and I thought I wanted ice cream, and\u2014 Ooh! Maybe we should check out the Crystal Empire, 'cause Twilight's castle is made out of crystals, so I totally had crystals on my mind.[magic warbling]",
    "Are you okay, Starlight? Because you seem a little, uh, what's the word... \"lch-bh-ba\".",

    "''Nuts!''[crash]",
    "Starlight!",

    "You are?",
    "I... I-I'm sorry. I had no idea you felt that way.",
    "Not gonna lie. Hearing you and those random ponies say all those terrible things about me wasn't easy. But I needed to hear it. Why didn't you just tell me how you felt?",
    "Pfft! Come on! It'd take a lot more than that to lose me. Our friendship is stronger than a few angry words.",
    "Listen, I'd take that over the boring pony you were becoming any day. The Starlight I love is passionate, lively, and yeah, sometimes angry. Those are my favorite parts of you. That and the fact that you forgive me every time.",
    "Deal. [gasps] I remembered what I was thinking about![bell rings]",
    "There's more to it than that. I was thinking about how glad I am to have met you, and I remembered our first meeting \u2013 here at the Ponyville spa. And now I just have to teleport it back!",
    "[simultaneously] Nothing!",
    "We'll meet you there! [to Starlight] Quick! Do you have a spell that will make the spa ponies forget that the map table was there?",
    "No. If we learned that lesson, how will we ever have fun?",

    "Everypony always says they'll give you a second chance, but deep down, they never forget.",

    "Can you keep a secret?",
    "[hushed] The things I've done? I did them because I was jealous of Twilight. She's just the best at ''everything'', and I wanted to beat her at ''something''!",
    "Thanks. Want to help me unpack my wagon?",
    "I spend a lot of time on the road with my wagon, so it might be a ''tad'' messy.",
    "[laughing]",
    "Sure. The wagon's right around the corner.",
    "Only when I'm wearing a soul-sucking evil amulet, so I don't think that counts. Funny story. Don't need to get into it.",
    "Well, of course! Great? Yes. Powerful? Obviously. But I'm not the ''best''. As great and powerful as I am, there's one trick I've never been able to do \u2013 the Moonshot Manticore Mouth Dive![silent film-type piano music and film reel flickering]",

    "Completely unharmed!",
    "Dangerous?",
    "I knew I liked you for a reason. I don't know how he did it! If I tried it, I'd get chewed up and swallowed by that manticore.",
    "Obviously. Way to rub it in.",
    "I guess that would work... But if you made one mistake, I'd be a goner.",
    "We call it \"assistant\" in the magician biz. And... nopony's ever offered to help before.",

    "Oh.",
    "What are friends for?",
    "Hmph, I wish I could say I was surprised. Well, lucky for ''Princess Twilight'', I have ''my'' magic show tonight. If you ''have'' to go to the dinner, I completely understand.

    "A-''ha!'' You still don't trust me! But guess what, ''princess''? It doesn't matter if you want to give me a second chance or not. Starlight had to choose between you and me, and she chose me! Your pupil chose me, so ''ha!'' I win!",
    "Exactly! [beat] Wait! I mean, no! I got caught up in the moment. I like you. Beating Twilight is just a bonus. [gasps] Saying that didn't help, did it?",

    "[sighs] Looks like the Great and Powerful Trixie is back to a solo show.",

    "Uh, thanks? Are we still doing lunch?[door opens]",
    "Wow. I heard the whole thing. And all I can say is I am humbled.",
    "I hadn't ever considered it, but hearing you say it out loud made me realize what a great and powerful vice headmare I'll be! Plus, we get to work ''and'' socialize at the same time!",
    "Oh, oh, no, of course not. I imagine there's a lengthy \"process\" to go through before you inevitably hire the \"best pony\" for the position. Wink.",

    "I'm sure you'll find a nice...[thud]",

    "I like cute, silly stuff! But ever since school started, I've realized that sometimes I kinda don't mind cute stuff.",
    "If a dragon like me can admit she likes tea parties, that's proof we ''can'' change. I was gonna invite you to a top-secret tea party with me, but if you want to stay down here...",
    "I thought that might work. Come on, let's go!",
    "We aren't leaving without them![spiders chittering]",
    "Of all the strange things that have happened tonight, that's the strangest, right?",
    "That's all very sweet. Now, can we please get out of here?![cracking sounds]",
    "Long story short, friendship ''is'' in our nature. The Tree said so.",

    "No. ''You'' don't. But they ''do''! I bet Headmare Twilight does! And you know what? I do, too! I actually got excited when I found out you were gonna be our coach! I figured if anypony can make cheer squad awesome, it's ''you''!",
    "Because everything's ''always'' awesome with you! Or twenty percent cooler! Or whatever! You're the most enthusiastic pony in Equestria when it's something ''you'' care about. I just wish ''we'' were one of those things.[door opens, closes]",

    "Hmph. Only gonna warn you once. Spike's my friend. You mess with him, you mess with me. Besides, he came here to hang out with ''you'', Garble.[beat]",
    "Eh, just ignore them, \"Gar-Gar\".",
    "Give him a chance, Garble. You guys have a lot in common.",
    "All the tough guy stuff is just an act. He's a big marshmallow.",
    "Well, maybe a burnt marshmallow. Smoky on the outside, but squishy inside. He just needs friends who can appreciate that part. Like you. You're not changing your mind about helping me cheer him up, are you?",
    "Okay! Lava jumping! Just like old times, huh, Gar-Gar?",

    "I'm the only one Garble will perform for. He hasn't written any poetry since I left. That's why he's been so sad.",
    "Wait. ''You've'' been picking on Spike?",
    "For a pony without a horn, she's sure got a point.",
    "You did it, Gar-Gar! You performed in front of other dragons!",
    "Yeah! Garble saved our eggs because he was strong enough to be who he is, whether you liked it or not. I grew up thinking it was okay to make fun of differences. But my friends have taught me to celebrate them.",

    "[voiceover] Dear Twilight, it is difficult to express how grateful I am to you for teaching me the power of friendship.",
    "[voiceover] You would think after more than a thousand years, there would be nothing left to learn.[wind whistling][clang!]",
    "[voiceover] And yet, even a pony as old as I can continue to be surprised by how much there is to know.[teleportation zap]",
    "Twilight?",
    "Why, studying friendship at Flim and Flam's wonderful school!",
    "[screams]",
    "[groans] It-It's really me.",
    "My travels brought me to Las Pegasus. I didn't come for the school, but Flim and Flam convinced me to try it out.",
    "I spent a thousand years thinking the worst of a \"bad\" pony. You taught me to look for the best in him. Whatever Flim and Flam's past may be, starting this school shows they want to change for the better.",
    "Besides, what's untrustworthy about opening a school of friendship? They don't even charge for classes.",
    "Twilight, I promise I'll visit your school soon. But for now, perhaps it's best if you return there.",
    "Well, gentleponies, I've finished another stack. The lessons in these worksheets are quite fascinating. Twilight? What's going on here?",
    "The only pony I see who is up to something is the pony in this picture, and it is not the princess I know.",
    "These lessons are so valuable. Are you sure I can't give you more?",
    "Return the bits you've collected from your students and close your school?",
    "[sighs] It seems I'll never stop learning from your example, Twilight. It is a valuable lesson to stand up for what you know is true. I wish I had known it, too.",
    "Well, I can refer you to a fairly reputable establishment just outside of Ponyville. I'm quite certain the headmare would consider letting you in.",
    "[narrating] The best elements within us can spread light and virtue, and I know ponies who represent them all \u2013 strength, bravery, healing, beauty, hope, and sorcery. Myself and these Pillars of Equestria were gathered together by another to maintain and share the light of these powerful ideals. But we soon came to believe the pony who brought us together only wanted that power for himself. Cast out and alone, this power-mad pony turned to darkness to satisfy his thirst. Transformed into a Pony of Shadows, he returned for revenge \u2013 to extinguish the Pillars' light and rob the world of hope. To stop him, the Pillars and I must make a grave sacrifice. But we shall leave behind a seed in hopes that one day it will grow into a force to stand against the darkness for all time. We must now face the fiend with the only plan we have...",
    "We did not come here to defeat you.[magic shimmering]",
    "We came... to ''contain'' you.",
    "What... What has happened?",
    "To where?",
    "What?! No, no, no, no! You must undo what you've done!",
    "You cannot bring us back!",
    "You cannot bring ''only'' the Pillars back![lightning strikes][ponies gasp]",
    "Spread out and stay ready, friends! Canterlot depends on us![booming][loud thud][zap!]",
    "You cannot bring ''only'' the Pillars back!",
    "You must return us to limbo. It's the only way to stop him.",
    "You have studied my writings. Surely you have some other plan.",
    "Know this, fiend! We will not rest until we find a way to return you to limbo!",
    "Then my spell worked \u2013 ''before'' it was meddled with \u2013 and the realm has been at peace for a millennia!",
    "We shall see. It is an easy thing to ''say'' you have saved the world. It is quite another to do it.",
    "Be that as it may, the problem of locating the Pony of Shadows remains, and this land is vast.",
    "Something about this magic seems familiar...[magic zap][ponies gasp]",
    "This map, and indeed this very castle, are grown from the seed we planted over a thousand years ago.",
    "More importantly, we no longer need Ponhenge to send our foe back to limbo. We can use the stored magic in this Tree of Harmony.",
    "Mm-hmm.",
    "If the Pony of Shadows has his way, your land will not exist. So unless you have a better idea...[magic zap]",
    "Our foe will seek dark places from which to draw power. I will prepare my spell so that we may strike as soon as you find him.",
    "It seems there are fewer dark corners in the realm these days.",
    "While I appreciate your enthusiasm, Twilight, this is hardly the time to take risks on half-baked spells.",
    "Hmm. I suppose there is a chance.",
    "Hmm... The Tree of Harmony acting to protect the light of the realm... Yes. A good thought, Twilight.",
    "I will make my notes on this spell. Ready yourselves for battle.",
    "I doubt we can save our homeland with a conversation.",
    "The Pony of Shadows was not interested in reconciliation. Once a villain, always a villain. Twilight, Sunburst, would you accompany me? I wish to refine this spell for our use.",
    "It is what must be done, and it would be best if we were not disturbed.",
    "Stygian was the name the Pony of Shadows gave up when he turned to darkness.",
    "Envy. He wanted more power than he had, and that desire led him down a path from which there is no return!",
    "Stygian wants to destroy all that is good in this world. There's no way to befriend a pony like that.",
    "A necessary sacrifice. With the Elements' power, we will bind the Pony of Shadows in limbo. And thanks to Twilight, we will remain to watch over the realm ourselves.[magic humming]",
    "The Elements are attuned to ''you''. We must use their magic in pairs.",
    "Prepare yourselves. He is here. Stygian! Show yourself and face us!",
    "We did what we had to do. You tried to steal our powers for yourself.",
    "Ready? Open the portal...[shatter!]",
    "...Now![magic shimmering][wind whistling][magic zap]",
    "Twilight! Push him in!",
    "Then we must help him![magic shimmering]",
    "Long ago, you needed our help, Stygian. But instead of listening, we turned our backs on you. Pride clouded my judgment. I owe you an apology. Thank you for helping us see the errors of our ways, Twilight. It seems I never accounted for the Magic of Friendship.",
    "[chuckles] Something tells me I will be making a lot of apologies today.",
    "I simply cannot believe how tall you've gotten!",
    "[chuckles] I'm not certain Canterlot is where I belong. The realm has grown, and I believe I'll have a look around before I settle in any one place.",
    "We would be honored. But if it is wisdom you seek, look no further than your own pupil. She showed me that the power of friendship is a magical force indeed. And that in turning away from others, you hurt yourself as well."

    "...''Headstallion Neighsay''.",
    "[claps] Thank you, Chancellor Neighsay, for that rousing speech. I know you're a stallion who truly believes what you say. And when you say this school will be run according to EEA doctrine, I know you mean it. ''And'' when you say there won't be any more lessons from the Princess of Friendship at the School of Friendship, I guess you mean that, too.[students murmuring]",
    "''But'' Twilight decided to run her school outside of the EEA guidelines. And even though you tried to stop her, Princesses Celestia and Luna trusted her enough to support her.[students murmuring]",
    "So, since I know you mean what you say, my question is really for the students. Are we going to give the pony who already tried to wreck Twilight's school once another chance to do it?[students dissenting]",
    "I guess things will have to stay the way Twilight wants them. Which includes leaving ''me'' in charge.[students shouting]",
    "Oh, oh, not too tight. We don't want to hurt the Chancellor.[padlock clanking]",
    "I'm sure Twilight will know what to do with him when she gets back. Now, back to class, everyone. We let the EEA disrupt our friendship studies long enough.[doors close]",
    "Oh, I do. You just aren't the pony I had in mind.[clank!]",
    "I can't very well have the EEA running the school if ''I'' want to run it myself. Of course, that's just the beginning. You see, if there's one thing I've learned here, it's that friendship is the most powerful thing there is. And as headmare of the School of Friendship, nopony will have more friends than me! Making me the most powerful pony in Equestria! [maniacal laughter]",

    "Destroy the School of Friendship?! Oh, dear! Chancellor Neighsay was wrong about a lot of things, but I guess he was right about all of you!",
    "After everything Twilight's done for you, why would you want to destroy her school?",
    "''Me?!'' We all just saw ''you'' with your claws all over them! [gasps] It all makes sense. These creatures want magic gone from Equestria because it's the only thing ponies have that they don't!",
    "And you repay her by sending her to Tartarus on a wild goose chase so you could destroy everything she built! [gasps] They've even trapped Starlight in that-that thing! We have to defend this school![students shouting]",
    "They brought this on themselves. There's nothing we can do.",
    "Yeah, yeah. The Elements of Harmony are very important. They're just not applicable in every circumstance. And with magic gone from Equestria, I'm not even sure the Tree of Harmony will be as helpful as it once was.[shimmering]",

The son of the Pharaoh, Prince Hisan, was so moved by her compassion that he decreed nopony would go hungry again. But when Hisan stood up to the Sphinx, the beast captured him, telling the Pharaoh the only way to get Hisan back was to solve her riddle. Nopony would volunteer to save the prince. Nopony except Somnambula.[adventurous music]",

To be without me costs you ''everything''.\" As Somnambula thought of the hardship she and her fellow villagers had experienced, she instantly knew the answer. \"Hope!\", she shouted.[Sphinx roaring]",
    "[narrating] The Sphinx was so enraged, it seemed she might still refuse to release the prince, so Somnambula asked her for one more challenge. But if she accomplished it, the Sphinx would leave from the kingdom forever. The Sphinx quickly agreed, asking only that Somnambula walk to the prince across a deep chasm... blindfolded! Further, the Sphinx had cast a powerful spell that prevented Somnambula from flying.[Sphinx laughing evilly]",
    "[narrating] But Somnambula never lost hope! She knew she'd need to make a leap of faith to save the prince. Guided by the sound of the prince's voice... she easily made it across.[Sphinx roaring]",

    "Fluttershy, you are not to blame. These things happen all the same.",
    "Oh. There's a healer of legend who never would fail. But I only know her from ancient folktales. Mystical and masked, she came in the night and cured everything from hoof cough to fur blight. What became of the healer, nopony knows, for she disappeared ages and ages ago.",
    "There's so many accounts of her power to heal. She can't just be a legend. I think she's real.",

    "Hmmm.",
    "Hmmm.",
    "I can cure this pony that is hoarse, but it will take a longer course.",
    "Mm. I can mix a brew that can work just right, but it cannot heal him by tonight.",

    "Remember when you pony folk stumbled into poison joke? Miss Fluttershy had an unusual change, deepening her vocal range.",

    "Ooh, he is starting to mature. Of this fact I am quite sure.",
    "A dragon's heart is prone to greed, a steady diet to make growth speed. Then, the resulting bigger size only makes their hunger rise. If this trait should go unchecked, if Spike continues to collect, more growth will certainly occur \u2013 he is going to turn into a monster.",
    "If his monstrous ways you wish to impede, you must prevent him from practicing greed.",
    "Stop! If they are changelings we'll soon see. Though I think they're not what they appear to be.",
    "Beneath this salve, no changeling hides, for it reveals the truth inside.[ponies gasping]",

    "I'm sure they seem strange, but my methods are mine. After all, I've been doing this for quite a long time.",
    "For your mane, of course, just soap will do, so use my super-sudsy shampoo.",
    "You were right to be concerned. Manes are tricky, I have learned.",
    "Cleaning is simple, but a magical fix could cause any number of troublesome ticks.",
    "Oh, there are tales I could tell to make your hair stand on end. Horrifying, terrifying attempts to mane-mend!",
    "There's the contagious frizz that spreads friend to friend, or the story of the infinitely splitting end!",
    "[laughs] There ''is'' one story I nearly forgot of an Earth pony who needed to clean up her shop.",
    "Perhaps it'd be better if I were more clear. You can't clean up Sugarcube Corner from here.",

    "I'm sorry, my dear, but there is nothing to say. You just took the wrong potion from here yesterday.",
    "No, this lack of hair was put into motion when you mistakenly washed with remover potion.",
    "As I mentioned before, there's no easy fix. Mane-mending magic's the trickiest of tricks.",
    "I doubt that your mane has left us forever. There is a chance we can fix it, I think, if we're clever.",
    "I need to focus if I'm to work any faster. One wrong ingredient spells utter disaster. You should go finish your list of to-dos. Keep your mind off of all of these mane-losing blues.[ponies chattering]",
    "At last, Rarity, I have searched for so long! What I told you before was totally wrong!",
    "Oh, no. I'm afraid I can't fix it before the big shoot. But in time, the hair will grow back from the root. There's no magical cure to hasten us through it, unless you went backward in time to undo it.",
    "Zecora knows just what to do about all this bad mojo that's floating around you.",
    "Zecora can take the bad away if you do just what I say.",
    "But before I can do my duty, I am going to need some of your booty.",
    "You think jewels are what you need, but there's no worse mojo than dragon greed.",
    "Ohhhh. Perhaps I can help those two get along before something here can go terribly wrong.{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}[birds chirping]",
    "Bringing him here seemed the right thing to do. I've never seen geckos breathe smoke though. Have you?",
    "Ahhh. Seeing what you two do, the real question is \u2013 can ''I'' help ''you''?",
    "Mm-hmm.",
    "Even the best of friends need help from time to time. Come visit me in my hut, should you change your mind.",
    "No need to sit and silently stew. Tell each other what's bothering you.",
    "Ahhh, such luck, your coming here indeed. Behold, the antidote you need.",
    "When trouble brews between you two, turning sister against brother, true understanding is what's due. Each must come to know the other. There's no time to waste. Go directly home. But you both must taste when you're finally alone.",
    "Quite a day, my fuzzy friend. Did things work out for you in the end?[beat]",
    "I'm... sorry, dear bunny, that things seem so grave. But I don't understand when you sign and wave. A single link to all the world. Only one in all the land. How special she must be to you, the one who understands. Perhaps if you explain what you wanted to some pony who understood. If you truly felt heard and valued, all would return to good. ''And'' if you were to both apologize, having learned this little lesson, I imagine that might bring an end to the friendship therapy session.[door creaking]{{portray|Angel}} [grunting]",
    "I'm glad to discover where the source of it lies, or the fire that he breathes would be quite the surprise.",
    "Follow me, and very soon, you'll hear the tale of Nightmare Moon.",
    "Listen close, my little dears, I'll tell you where you got your fears of Nightmare Night, so dark and scary. [blows] Of Nightmare Moon, who makes you wary.",
    "Every year, we put on a disguise, to save ourselves from her searching eyes.",
    "But Nightmare Moon wants just one thing to gobble up ponies in one quick swing!",
    "Hungrily, she soars the sky. If she sees nopony, she passes by. So if she comes and all is clear, Equestria is safe another year!",
    "A perfect question, my little friend. For Nightmare Moon you must not offend. [blows] Fill up her belly with a treat or two, so she won't return to come eat you!",
    "Come, little Pip. Now don't you fret. Nightmare Night's not over yet. We still have candy left to give, so Nightmare Moon might let us live.",
    "In what way can you tell that they are indeed under a spell?",
    "Ah. A friendship with Discord is truly a shock. But who says it is something that we must block?",
    "Alright. This potion will break the spell, then you will be able to tell.",
    "It ties the room together and emits a warm glow. But if I am to be honest, it's just for show.",
    "Ugh. Have you gone mad?",
    "Oh, monster of so little size. Is that a parasprite before my eyes?",
    "Tales of crops and harvests consumed. If these creatures are in Ponyville, you're doomed.",
    "From my home, I have had to flee! The forest has grown too wild, even for me!",
    "I'm afraid it is a mystery to me as well, but I may have something that, if combined with a spell... I do not dare to use it myself, the results would be tragic. It only responds to Alicorn magic. Princess Twilight, you can turn the potion from purple to white. After a sip, you may see why the sky is day and night.",
    "[nose plugged] When it comes to breakouts, I've seen all circumstances. But as with the molt smell... let's not take any chances.",
    "The ailments you have aren't something to cure. The molt's a condition that dragons endure.",
    "Perhaps we can lessen this strange molt effect. The smell is the most likely cause, I suspect.",
    "I know you are speaking, but I can't hear a thing. Are you talking about teaching asparagus to sing?",
    "If the goal is to not have your friends all depart, perhaps your volume is where we should start.[stomach rumbling]",
    "I have volume concerns today by the scores. But it seems that I'm ready to help you with yours.",
    "Ah, the feathers of that bird can affect ponies' ears. It's a magic ailment I've treated for years.",

    "The cream that you want is just over here. It's a popular potion for all creatures this year.",
    "Rarity's gone. There's no need to hide. [sniffs, groans] Though I wonder if we should continue outside. Can't treat your symptoms down there on the ground. It's safe to come out. There's no ponies around.",
    "That's something that would've been quite nice to know! But it's not worth discussing right now! We should go![roc screeching]",
    "You can't hide in a tree! You have to come down! We stand a much better chance on the ground! [screams]",

    "Turns out we have a lot in common! We both come from cultures that don't have the friendliest of reputations.",

    "Hey, Spike!",
    "Actually, I think I will. I got your scroll. The Great Gem Crevasse sounds a lot better than doing my rounds.",
    "Whoa! It was definitely better! I gotta get back to Griffonstone, but you have to tell me all about the Crevasse tomorrow!",
    "Okay! Start from the beginning, because I want to hear everything!",
    "That is amazing! Then what?![thud]",
    "Whoa!",
    "Nah! Are you kidding? It's Power Ponypalooza! You have to go! And now you'll have ''two'' things to tell me about!",
    "[echoing] Spike? I got your note! I figured I'd come by before my rounds with a bowl of energizing turnip soup.",
    "Spike?",

    "[squeals] I'm just about the most excited anygriffon has ever been about anything!",
    "What for? What for?! Everypony in town tells me of your amazing assistance! How you help ponies find their place in the world!",
    "And that's why I'm here. I need help, too. I want you to give me a cutie mark!",
    "Gabby, 'kay?",
    "[slurping under]",
    "Right? Right?! ''Right?!''[thud]",
    "You're tellin' me! I don't know if you've heard, but griffons can be a little bit... unfriendly.",
    "[voiceover] Most griffons don't pay much attention to each other. And if they do, it's not, y'know, the good kind of attention. As for me, I'm just a little mail delivery griffon who likes to spread a little bit of griffon-y sunshine on my rounds, which always makes me feel different from the other griffons.[doors slamming]",
    "[voiceover] I'd do anything for any old griffon in need.",
    "[voiceover] But it just always seemed like the harder I tried, the less I fit in. It wasn't until your friends came to Griffonstone that I realized some creatures actually like helping each other, and I saw something so awesomely awesome \u2013 how helping spreads from pony to pony and griffon to griffon! I knew then that I had to find out why I was so different from the other griffons, and I knew the answer just had to have something to do with those wonderful, amazing marks on the ponies' flanks. And I admit, hehe, I became, um, maybe a little obsessed. So first chance I had to deliver a letter from Gilda, I took it, so I could find the perfect pony to help me understand what those marks are. Everypony here told me one thing \u2013 I just ''had'' to see the Cutie Mark Crusaders! They've helped everypony here get their cutie marks, and I knew, I just ''knew'', that someday I'd have one, too! A cutie mark of my very own!",
    "That's why I flew all the way here! I want to find my own place in the world, and I know you can help me by giving me a cutie mark! So let's make with the cutie! [giggles] Whenever you're ready. Did it happen yet?",
    "Howboutnowhowboutnowhowboutnowhowboutnow?",
    "Oh. I hadn't thought of that. Sounds like a challenge! And who could be up to it but the world-famous Cutie Mark Crusaders? Cutie marks! It's in your name and everything, right? Right?! ''Right?!'' Now I have to deliver Gilda's letter to Rainbow Dash. I bet by the time I get back, you'll have it one hundred percent figured out! Toodles for now! Whee-hee-hee! Gonna get my cutie mark!",
    "''Incoming!''[thud]",
    "Hiya, you wonderful, wonderful Crusaders! I just know you've figured out how to help me because you're all so incredible!",
    "I'm getting a cutie mark!!! Woo-hoo-hoo! [yelling excitedly]",
    "[rhythmically] Cutie mark! Cutie mark! Gonna get my cutie mark! [yelling excitedly]",
    "What do you think my mark will be? A lightning bolt? An erupting volcano? I don't care if it's a jar of marmalade! I know I'll love it, whatever it is!",
    "''What?!?''",
    "Oh! [laughs] Is that all? You had me worried for a second. I-I mean, there's a first time for everything, right? And she didn't say it was impossible, right?",
    "Well, then if anypony can make it happen, it's you three. I mean, you haven't failed yet.",
    "Oh! It's gonna happen! I can feel it! Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo! [laughs]",
    "All right. Let's do this.",
    "Wow! I kinda wanna just try everything! I mean, I don't even ''know'' what to pick!",
    "I did... it... all! So, lay it on me, Crusaders. What's my purpose? And how do we get a mark on these here haunches?",
    "Wait. What are you saying?",
    "But, but... you're the world-famous Cutie Mark Crusaders! I can't believe it! I... I... I ''won't'' believe it!",
    "Failed? Then what do you call ''this''?!",
    "Uh... I don't know. Maybe it means my purpose is, uh, helping Zecora with potions. That was the first thing I tried. I guess it just took some time to appear. But here it is!",
    "Oh, uh, totally! Um, but, you know, Rainbow Dash asked me to pick up her answer to Gilda's letter. I better take care of that before I forget. Heh. Here's an idea. Uh, y-you head to the castle, and I'll meet you there, cutie mark and all! Um... toodles![whoosh]",
    "Um... Sorry, no time to chat. I-I just stopped to help this pony get out of the muck, and then I really gotta fly. Okay? Heave-ho! [grunts][splat]",
    "Running away? Oh, I'm not running away. I'm just, uh, e-excited to show my lovely new cutie mark to everyone in Griffonstone!",
    "[defeated] Yup... That's the one. I guess the one thing I'm really not good at is faking things.",
    "Sure, I was disappointed. But I didn't do it to make ''myself'' feel better. I wanted to make ''you'' feel better.",
    "I couldn't bear you three thinking you failed after you tried so hard to help. That's why I had to leave before you or Twilight found out the truth. [sighs] I'm sorry I wasn't honest with you. I'll just wing my way back to Griffonstone. Thanks for trying.",
    "I know you all tried your very best, but I guess griffons and cutie marks just don't mix. Maybe... I don't even have a special purpose.",
    "Well... I was really glad I helped you feel happier.",
    "But helping just feels good. I-It couldn't have anything to do with what I'm supposed to do with my life... right?",
    "But they look just like yours. You can't mean...! [gasps]",
    "Awesome! My very own cute-cea\u00f1era![chatter in background]",

    "Once upon a time, in the magical land of Equestria, there were two regal sisters who ruled together and created harmony for all the land. To do this, the eldest used her unicorn powers to raise the sun at dawn; the younger brought out the moon to begin the night. Thus, the two sisters maintained balance for their kingdom and their subjects, all the different types of ponies. But as time went on, the younger sister became resentful. The ponies relished and played in the day her elder sister brought forth, but shunned and slept through her beautiful night. One fateful day, the younger unicorn refused to lower the moon to make way for the dawn. The elder sister tried to reason with her, but the bitterness in the young one's heart had transformed her into a wicked mare of darkness Nightmare Moon.[lightning crack]",
    "She vowed that she would shroud the land in eternal night. Reluctantly, the elder sister harnessed the most powerful magic known to ponydom the Elements of Harmony. Using the magic of the Elements of Harmony, she defeated her younger sister, and banished her permanently in the moon. The elder sister took on responsibility for both...",
